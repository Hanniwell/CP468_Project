8 years ago Coyote blood in eye!? So i was skinning a coyote i had shot, and while skinning i hit a vein with my knife and blood squirted into my right eye. Are there any parasites in coyote blood that could enter through my eye and make me sick or something?
Another question i have about coyote's is if i want to pull out a k9 tooth to make a necklace, what do i need to do to sterilize or make the tooth safe?
Thanks! Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Anonymous 8 years ago Favorite Answer Coyotes can be infected with distemper, hepatitis, parvo virus, rabies, and tularemia. Rinse your eye out and use antibiotic eye drops. See a doctor asap. And just leave the teeth in boiling water for a few minutes. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 8 years ago You should definitely get your eye checked out 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
