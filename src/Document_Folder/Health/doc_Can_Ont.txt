8 years ago Can Ontario Paramedics administer antibiotics? just wondering if they were authorized / licenced\/ Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Anonymous 8 years ago Favorite Answer There are there levels of Paramedic in Ontario. Primary Care Paramedics, Advanced Care Paramedics and Critical Care Paramedics.
Only the Critical Care Paramedics are able to administer antibiotics. CCPs work in the Critical Care Transport programs both in ground and air transport (ORNGE, etc).
These are high acuity transfers either from ICU to ICU, or from a small outlying hospital to an ICU in a major centre.
CCPs do not work on 911 response ambulances. Source(s):
