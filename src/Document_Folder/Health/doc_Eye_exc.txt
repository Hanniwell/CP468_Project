1 decade ago Eye excrement question? So I get these little white balls of gunk in the corners of my eyes about 2-3 times a day. My mom calls them "sleepers". I know my boyfriend never gets them. Why do I? And it seems excessive that I have to take them out 2-3 times a day. If I don't take them out, they come out on their own onto the skin next to my eyes. Any explanations would be helpful. Thanks. Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer There are oils and mucous in your eyes constantly.
This builds up in the 'waste gate' of our eye, where you are experiencing these 'white balls of gunk'.
It happens to many people,.. especially upon awakening from a nap or sleep. It is often exacerbated by dry eyes, or insufficient tearing to 'wash away' this mucous/tear/oil buildup. It is simply a byproduct of the eye, if it really bothers you an eye doctor should be able to determine a very specific pathology and perhaps some treatment.
