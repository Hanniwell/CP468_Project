1 decade ago Fluticasone nasal Spray for sinus infection ? Hi, I have been suffering from Acute Sinus infection from past 2/3 weeks. I got this infection after cold. I am on the 6th day of 10 day course of antibiotic (amoxil). My symptoms were not getting better especially congestion (facial/nasal). Doctor presribed me today Fluticasone Spray, I used this spray first time today and after 10 minutes my pressure felt better. Just want to ask if anyone else have used it and how was the experience ??? Any side effects ? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer it is important to point out that in a placebo-controlled trial,
1/4 of the patients given amoxicillin 1/4 of patients given nasal steroid (like your fluticasone) 1/4 of patients given BOTH treatments 1/4 of patients given placebo - no active medicine at all. There was no benefit at all -- of the antibiotic, the steroid, or both treatments. It will no doubt take years for this knowledge to leak into clinical practice, but this is just the latest of several studies that show the same thing - that these medications do NOT benefit people with a diagnosis of "sinusitis". Having said that, if you have nasal symptoms that are purely due to allergies, then a steroid nasal spray is exactly what you need.
You just cannot show any benefit in the setting of acute sinusitis. Hopefully this data will get doctors to stop the tremendous (non-beneficial) used of antibiotics for this condition, which only makes bacteria more resistant world-wide, but in truth does not make the patient any better than taking a sugar pill would.
