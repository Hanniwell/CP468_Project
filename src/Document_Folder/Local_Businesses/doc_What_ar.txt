1 decade ago What are some good clothing stores around Toronto? I'm 18 and going up in a couple of weeks with some decent spending money, which I hope to get rid of. I'm wondering where the best, fairly reasonably priced, cool places are. Good vintage stores, or really any place where annoying hipsters congregate, are in my taste. I am a male, which is an important point to consider. Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance M. Lv
