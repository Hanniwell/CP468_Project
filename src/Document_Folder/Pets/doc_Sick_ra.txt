8 years ago Sick rabbit and PJ's Pets 15-Day Health Guarantee? I bought a 3 month old male rabbit from PJs Pets a week ago (the 19th) and the day after I bought him, he began sneezing. At first I figured he just had dust in his nose, but he was doing it several times in a row and fairly often. Today, however, he sneezed one stream of white mucous. He hasn't done it since, but he's been shaking his head a lot and rubbing his nose. I did some research and I think he may have snuffles.
Since it's only been a week, my rabbit has a 15 day health guarantee at PJ's Pets and I was wondering if anyone knew what this meant. Will they reimburse my vet fees or the cost of antibiotics? It's my first time having a rabbit so I'm fairly stressed. I don't want him dying on me since my younger sisters would be devastated. However if it's something he already had while he was at the pet store, I find it fairly irresponsible of them to sell me a sick rabbit and I really think I should be reimbursed in some way! Help!

* 15 day health guarantee provided the small pet receives appropriate care after they leave our store.
* Any limitations to the health guarantee will be outlined at the time of sale.
* Should a health problem arise, you must contact the store immediately to validate the warranty. We will not reimburse veterinary expenses incurred without our authorization.
* If you have any problems, questions or concerns regarding the health and care of your new pet, please do not hesitate to contact the store.
* In the event of the loss of your pet within the guarantee period, please return the pet to the store with the register receipt and written invoice. We will replace the pet or provide an in-store credit for the purchase value.
* A pet will only be replaced once. There is no guarantee on the replacement pet.
* There is no guarantee on gender, temperament, age, or suitability for breeding.
* With the exception of health related issues, there are no refunds or exchanges. in other words, you need to contact the store and find out what you need to do, since they say they don't reimburse vet expenses that they didn't authorize first 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
