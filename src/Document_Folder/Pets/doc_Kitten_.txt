1 decade ago Kitten afterbirth question? My friends cat just had her kittens starting at 7:30pm, she had what we think is the last one at 9:45. Does the afterbirth only come after ALL the kittens have been born or can there be more kittens after that? We thought we felt one moving inside her but then she expelled the afterbirth. Since then there have been no more kittens but two more afterbirths. Will she have more kittens? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance incantato Lv
4 1 decade ago Favorite Answer There should be one placenta for every kitten.
So make sure that you have counted them all.
If one gets left in her she can get a real bad infection fast.
So yes there could still be more kittens if you feel them. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago they should be a sac after every kitten, and she will no longer be having contractions if u fell more maby you need to go to a vet !! she could die from not getting AL of them out!!
