6 years ago What makes a great riding instructor? Hi guys. So, in your opinion, what are the qualities that make a great instructor. If possible, please use examples from your own instructor, but remember to respect personal privacy. Thanks. :) Answer Save 4 Answers Relevance Bec Lv

I think firstly it depends on what you want from an instructor and what your goals are. Personally I like an instructor who is people minded. They may work with horses but every rider is human and the instructor should be able to communicate well with them.
- understand not everyone learns the same - come up with new ways of explaining things and think outside the box for some explanations - I personally struggle with my heels. Thinking "toes up" is easier for me. Talking about position etc and which muscles need to be moving - some people just know, some people need to think about sitting on back pockets. My instructor - "if you were a boy, point it at the ceiling.." - we all had a good laugh but it was just a different way of explaining it - understand not all riders are as good as you - an instructor needs to realise that some people have a natural ability, others don't. Everyone struggles with something.
- is friendly and approachable - no matter how silly the question I want to be able to speak up and not feel stupid or be laughed at.
Its nice if they have a sense of humour and there is some degree of joking. Riding doesn't have to be serious - for example, my instructor asked us all what we do and think when a horse spooks at nothing (purely because the horses had been napping at the gate pretending to be scared) - most of the riders said "I think sit up, heels down, leg on" - I was honest. I think "oh sh*t!" - he took that in good humour and said that you need to push that thought out and think of a practical solution (e.g legs on) - pushes you but respects no - there are occasions where you just want to give up. A good instructor should try to push you throug that barrier but respect that you may still say no.
Someone in my lesson developed a fear of jumping. She refused for weeks but the instructor made her go over a tiny cross pole first so she didn't have time to freak herself out. He challeneged her but not to the extent she was more fearful - able to quickly change the plan/activity (this ties in with approachable and pushing you) - for example - some instructors may set up a 2ft jump. Every rider in that lesson can safely jump that high but someone is having a bad day (or a horse is playing up or whatever) - the rider is uncomfortable jumping that height. A good instructor should pick up on this and offer to lower it or change it slightly so the rider still jumps but it's easier due to circumstances There's probably a lot more but thinks like that 2 4 0 ...

7 6 years ago Report Thanks for your answers, everyone. :) Login to reply the answers Post Nikkita 6 years ago 1.Someone who's patient with me and if I need help tacking up will show me how to tack up and then make me do it myself, and if I need a step repeated show me again 2.Someone with a good attitude. They need to be nice and respect me, I don't and won't take an bs from anyone, which includes yelling constantly. 3.Someone who will correct me when I do something wrong or have trouble with and will keep me at it till I get it. 4.Someone who will motivate and every now and then yell out steps along the route, things to correct or the timings for the posting trot. 5.A certain amount of chemistry is required. Just like when you know a horse is the "one," so too do you know when a coach is good or bad for you. 6.Trust if you trust you're instructor then you are more likely to relax and enjoy the sport more which will also make it safer and easier to ride because you are not tense in the saddle which allows you to move with the horse more 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Snezzy Lv
7 6 years ago My wife tells me that the late Hans Kuhse was a great instructor. He taught the methods of the German cavalry, generally ascribed to the famous cavalry manual from 1912. You rode HIS way, not your way. He was patient, but apparently very insistent. (When a Nazi officer tells you how to ride, that's how you ride.) My wife's riding style is indistinguishable from that of Hr. Kuhse's more recent students. Bec's answer is on target, as well. A good instructor engages the mind of the student--"What do you do and think?"--and when training horses engages the mind of the horse, as was taught by Pluvinel. 0 2 0 Login to reply the answers Post Seabreeze 6 years ago Qualities my AMAZING instructor has... -kindness (ex. Very gentle with words. never yells or screams at me)
-forgiveness (ex. Doing something completely different that she wanted me to do but she always forgives :))
-LOADS of encouragement (ex. You can do it! Good girl! That looks amazing! You've come so far! That's lovely! Very nice!)
-tell me it's ok (Ex. fell off 3 times in one lesson Infront of 3 other ppl. She kept saying it's ok, you've done good, be proud, it's ok to fall off, bad days happen to everyone, lots of hugs!)
-things to work on (ex. she lets me know after every lesson, what I could improve on, but what I did good at)
-good job! (I get a "good job" wity a smile after every lesson, even if I did bad)
-trust (I trust her and she trusts me. That just comes with time for any one)
-Talks to me through the lesson
-is always on time
-has fun activities planed (once in a while, I'll have a fun lesson, such as bareback)
Hope this helps! Source(s):
