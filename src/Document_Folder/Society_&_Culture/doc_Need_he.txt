1 decade ago Need help with Japanese from Shogun Total War game? I am fairly conversant in Japanese and somewhat literate as well, but I just can't seem to catch what the emissaries are saying and I cannot quite get what the game's narrator says when you kill the opposing side's general in a battle.
If I could catch the sounds, I could look it up myself, but for some reason my ears can't catch what they are saying. Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance اري Lv
