7 years ago Describe what you did to administer your survey? I have a family studies project and one of the questions asks, " What did you do to adminster your survey" What exactly does that mean. HELP Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Schmitty 6 years ago Favorite Answer It probably means "What did you do to administer your survey?"
I believe, in this context, they want to know how you applied the survey; specifically, the family studies project wants you to communicate what methods you used to get the survey out or how you asked the questions in the survey to different people. Source(s):
