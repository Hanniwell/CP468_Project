9 years ago what reason did Luke give for writing the gospel? Answer Save 7 Answers Relevance Anonymous 9 years ago Favorite Answer Luke 1 Dedication to Theophilus
1 Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled[a] among us, 2 just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us, 3 it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, 4 that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed. It's pretty much in his prologue to his Gospel, luke compiled his gospel like an investigative reporter and just wanted everyone to know the truth. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Kevin C 9 years ago If we don't know who wrote it, how do we know Luke didn't right it?
Who wrote Mark, John, Matthew?
The books weren't named by the writers yes.
Tradition is how all the books were named.
Luke did write the Gospel of Luke. The author of the Third Gospel and of the Acts is the most versatile of all New Testament writers. He can be as Hebraistic as the Septuagint, and as free from Hebraisms as Plutarch. . . He is Hebraistic in describing Hebrew society and Greek when describing Greek society". His great command of Greek is shown by the richness of his vocabulary and the freedom of his constructions. 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 9 years ago The writer (to whom we've given the name "Luke") wrote it for Theophilus, "that you [Theophilus] may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught".
IOW, they said it so I'm going to repeat it.
He was the first one to ride a Christian's coat-tails. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 9 years ago Luke didn't write it. no one knows who actually wrote it. 0 2 1 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?
