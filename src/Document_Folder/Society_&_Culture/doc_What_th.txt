You will find out that people from Montenegro speak a variety of different languages.
Montenegrin, Serbian, Serbo-Croatian, or Serbo-Montenegrin.
Check out the link below.
You could tell him your interested in learning the language he speaks.
He will probably teach you.
This would be another way to get closer to him. Source(s):

5 1 decade ago he is saying that he went to school today and already he doesnt feel like going. if he isnt able to wake up tomorow for school, god kill him( dnt worry, its just a popular expression used by us from montenegro). he says he is gonna cut his first 2 classes and will go to school at 12 o clock when he isnt sleepy and then go to his 2 leftover classes.
