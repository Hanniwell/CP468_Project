7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer I will study for an exam tonight:
Future tense (in strict grammar and in the normal speech of South East England, this means a determination so to do, in opposition to the normal future, "I shall study") i am going to study for an exam tonight-
(A more colloquial way of expressing futurity. In strict grammar this is a present tense, since it means you have now made your mind up about a future intention). i am studying for an exam tonight.
Present continuous, meaning that you are doing it now, although it is often used colloquially to show intention. i will be studying for an exam tonight.
Future continuous, emphasizing the process. As in the first case, strict grammar would prescibe "shall". i will have studied for an exam tonight.
Future perfect, describing your situation after your period of study has ended. Again, strict grammar would prescribe "shall." i will have been studying for an exam tonight.
Future perfect continuous: the same as the previous, but emphasizing the duration of the process. More a theoretical grammatical possibility than a form you are very likely to meet. And again, prescriptive grammar would substitute "shall" for "will." In traditional grammar, "will" in the first person is used to express contradiction or determination, as in: "You won't do any studying tonight, will you?" "Oh yes, I WILL." Curiously, traditional grammar makes the opposite use of "will" versus "shall" in the 2nd and 3rd persons, e.g. "He will not study tonight." "Oh yes, he SHALL." 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Natty_Dread Lv
