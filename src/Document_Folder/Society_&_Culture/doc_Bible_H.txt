6 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Peace be to this house (Luke 10:5) Truth is truth it is not my truth but God the Father's truth as spoken by Jesus. 54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?
57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.
58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matt 13:54-58 (KJV) -------------------------------------------- 46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
Matt 12:46-50 (KJV) --------------------------------------------- 31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
Mark 3:31-35 (KJV) --------------------------------------------- 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.
20 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.
Luke 8:19-21 (KJV) -------------------------------------------- 25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold THY son!
27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold THY mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. John 19:25-27 (KJV) IF Jesus would have honoured Mary His mother he would have said, behold MY mother and the disciple Jesus loved, Jesus would have said, behold MY brother, but Jesus did not. Sess why Jesus honoured Mary sister of Lazarus and not His own mother in Luke 10:38-42 and understand. Remember Mary sister of Lazarus, for she anointed Jesus at the hour of His death. (Matthew 26:13, John 11:1-2, Luke 10:38-42) I am not a Christian, I am a disciple of Jesus, and I not only read each and every word the man called Jesus alone spoke, but I do as all the words Jesus only spoke tell me to do. I am Gnostic, for I am one who believes in only the teachings of the Holy Ghost and the Spirit of Truth. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post robert C Lv

Trying to CHEAT!?!?!?
Such a thing has never happened!!!!
I suppose technically what you are doing is not cheating in the eyes of the Pope since he really doesn't want you to read the Bible for yourself anyway.
I recommend getting to know God for real.
Read your Bible.
Do your homework.
Be honest.
