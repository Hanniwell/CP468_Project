4 4 years ago 4 weeks and is usually introduced on thursdays so it has good sales during the weekend. They usually do a new collection every 6 to 7 weeks. This one Naughty Nauticles just was released a week ago or so so just be patient. Hope this helps and sorry I don't have any info on what will be coming next. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post this girl Lv
