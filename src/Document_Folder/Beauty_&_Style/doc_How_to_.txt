8 years ago How to style an oversize sweatshirt? Kay so I had an old sweatshirt hoodie that didn't fit right anymore ( It got too short on the bottom and my head didn't fit through the top anymore.. I got an idea from youtube and I cut off the hood to make it look better so I can still wear it. The neck is kinda wide. Not deep but it goes pretty far across my shoulders and the bottom elastic type thing goes a little bit lower than a crop top. It looks like the type of sweat shirts that our in style this year haha :) I wanna wear it tomorrow but I'm not sure how I could style it without it looking weird.. I wanna be warm cause its cold hear where I live and theres rumours of a fire drill tomorrow.. I tried it over a tshirt but it looked weird, and im just getting over being sick so I dont want too much skin showing.. The neck also isn't wide enough for it to go over the shoulder or anything.. If you don;t know what i mean this is the link to the video:

This is kinda what the shirt looks like: http://www.polyvore.com/miss_chievous_leopard_wome... http://www.polyvore.com/tna_newport_shirt/thing?id... http://www.polyvore.com/ron_jon_sunset_heart_off/t...
