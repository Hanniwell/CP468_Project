7 6 years ago Favorite Answer It's a good look. The sweater top hides the cute front zip detail on the skirt, however. I'd get a marled grey thinner top that I could tuck in for the front and flow free in the back for a high low look. Then the design of the skirt would be seen!! : } 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Zebra Gal 6 years ago Very cute. A little short but I agree with the top commenter that it would be nice to see some of the skirt detail. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Ashley M Lv
7 6 years ago The skirt is a little short for my own personal tastes, but other than that, I like it. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 6 years ago i really like it! not sure about the boots with the short skirt but nice seperately. i would wear black plimpsole kind of shoes with that, that also makes it a bit more casual 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
