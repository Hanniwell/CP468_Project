7 years ago How do you change your profile name? Without changing you activity name? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Ariana Lv
7 7 years ago Favorite Answer You absolutely do not have to have the same name on both profiles. It does not work that way. Go to
http://profile.yahoo.com
and hover over your display name. Double click it (a box should appear around it), and then change it to whatever you want. Click enter when done. It made me do that twice before the name on my profile would change, so you may have to repeat those steps again or even a third time.
Doing this will change your display name on your Yahoo Profile, but NOT on Yahoo Answers. I changed my name from Ariana to Ariana2013 just to test it, and it worked. My YA name did not change. If you want to change your Yahoo Answers display name, go to My Activity > Edit My Preferences > Change name. If you are asking how to change your Yahoo ID (login), that is not possible, sorry. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
