7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer I have heard the CC-300 ( afew years old now) is a great centre, particulalry if matched to Paradigm mains.
I have not seen the back of the speakers, but 4 terminals (a feature on better speakers) usually means the speaker can be bi-amped. That is, the tweeters and midrange/woofer connected to separate amplifiers. This improves the sound somewhat, but is an expensive way to go. Google "biamp+speaker" That said, the terminals are usually colour coded (black and red are common) and wired in pairs for normal use with one amp. So, make sure the two black and two red (or whichever coding is used, the like terminals) are each wired together with a jumper strip or heavy wire (that is, red to red and black to black), then connect your receiver so the centre red (or +) terminal is connected to one of the brdged red terminals on the CC-300 and the centre black (or -) terminal on the receiver is connected to one of the bridged black terminals on the CC-300. Happy listening. 0 0 2 Login to reply the answers Post The Eagle Keeper Lv
7 1 decade ago I have a Legacy Silver Screen center ch speaker and it too has 4 speaker terminals. I have the speaker bi-amped using two marantz MA500 mono-block amps. This monster of a ctr ch spkr requires that kind of power so it sounds great. By using that much clear quality power, the center ch really stands out and makes the voices very clear and focused. Once you do this type of hook up, I assure you that you will be amazed and will always want your home theater set up this way. See the links below, they may be of use to you. Source(s):

Here's what to do: Connect a Negative wire and a Positive wire together, twist them together and tape it up, now connect the - & + remaining to the center channel amp connection. This way (series connection) you will keep the impedence at either 4 or 8 ohms, if you do it (paralell as described above & below)by combining the 2 + and the 2 - then you will drive up the impedence to 16 or 32 ohms and burn up the amp...VERY IMPORTANT!
***Never bridge a stereo amp that dosnt have a bridge mono impedence switch, or you will burn up the amp and destroy the speakers voice coil*** Source(s):
