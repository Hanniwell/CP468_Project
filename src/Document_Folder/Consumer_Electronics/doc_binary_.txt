9 years ago binary search algorithm, ( tertiary search).? I am looking for an algorithm that search for an element in a list of increasing integers, by splitting the list into 3 sub lists of almost equal to zero ( where the difference in size is at most one) and restricting the search to the appropriate piece.

4 9 years ago Favorite Answer Algorithm TertiarySearch(key, list, beginList, endList) ... key is the number to search for in list (integer) ... list contains n numbers (object) ... beginList is the recursive start of list (integer) ... endList is the recursive end of list (integer) ... 1. if beginList > endList then 2. ... return -1; // The key was not found ... 3. int first = floor( sizeof(list) ); 4. int second = 2 * first; ... 5. if key < list[first] then 6. ... TertiarySearch(key, list, beginList, first-1); 7. else if key = list[first] then 8. ... return key; 9. else if ( list[first] < key < list[second] ) then 10. .. TertiarySearch(key, list, first+1, second-1); 11. else if key = list[second] then 12. .. return key; 13. else 14. .. TertiarySearch(key, second+1, endList); It really is just an extension of the BinarySearch(key, list, beginList, endList).
You call this algorithm by using int index = TertiarySearch(key, list, 0, n-1); 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post tfloto Lv
6 9 years ago You would do it the same as a binary search only you keep splitting by thirds. The advantage of using tertiary vs binary is minimal. For example it would take 8 compares to find the item in a list of 256 items. it would take 6 compares (best case typical) in a tertiary search same order of magnitude and not worth the complexity.
Worst case it would take 10 compares so it averages out to the same as a binary. 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
