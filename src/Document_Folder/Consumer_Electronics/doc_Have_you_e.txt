7 14 hours ago I know several people who do not own or use cell phones. Mainly because they don't need them. They are either at home or work, both of which have landlines. They use car services, so again no need for a phone. Are they lucky? No idea, but it works for them.  1 0 Anonymous 15 hours ago I've never had one, don't have one & never will have one.  I've no use for them at all.   4 0 How do you think about the answers?
