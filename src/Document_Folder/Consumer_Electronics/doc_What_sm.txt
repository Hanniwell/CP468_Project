4 9 years ago Favorite Answer MP5K and AK47u are by far the best smgs mp5k works great with a suppressor and is perfect for game modes like S&D and basically anything else 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Supermaan17FTW 9 years ago Mp5k has a BUNCH of recoil, suppressor doesn't do a thing to stop recoil, so I say ak74u..
Less recoil, and better gun overall.
I used ak74u on my account, 1.79 KD bro.
U could also invest in the spectre, it's pretty solid... Source(s):
