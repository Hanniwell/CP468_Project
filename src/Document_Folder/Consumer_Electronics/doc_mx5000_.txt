i would play with the settings in there to enable connectivity under "mode of operation" to "visible and connectable for other devices". i would also go to services and enable serial service. i would also consider enabling "automatically authorise incoming requests". you are aiming to find your keyboard listed in the list of "bonded devices". if the keyboard is already listed as a bonded device when you open the preferences, then it should be unnecessary to change any settings as i have suggested above. once you have the keyboard and mouse bonded, go to the links i have listed below to learn how to setup some of the more advanced features of the keyboard and mouse. if the keyboard wont bond that easily for you then the third link i have listed is a nasty looking howto on getting your system to bond with the keyboard. i hope it doesnt come to that but apparently it works =o\ Source(s):
