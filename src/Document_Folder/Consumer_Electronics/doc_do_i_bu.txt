1 decade ago do i buy a real piano or keyboard? I"m beginning as soon as i buy a keyboard or piano. I'm 20, i had a keyboard before, it was old and beaten up, i liked it alot, but i lost it in a great volcano.
My budget is 200 bananas, i see on a used stuff for sale website that theres real pianos that are alot cheaper then keyboards, and pianos haave everything right? i mean they have weighted keys and stuff, like the real deal. But then again there heavy as **** and it'll be hard to bring them up in my apartment. Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance GLaDOSwantsCaek 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Keyboards and pianos are different.
You should do some research and see which one is better for you.
Since you already had experience with keyboards, I suggest you get a keyboard.
Really, it depends on what you want to do with one.
And remember; a piano is going to be much
more expensive and harder to move.
Though keyboards can be expensive too, pianos are expensive by default and take up a lot of space.
On the other hand, keyboards tend to lose pitch after a few years.
So, it's up to you.
I'm not sure if you can get the pitch fixed for a keyboard though...either way, have fun! 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
