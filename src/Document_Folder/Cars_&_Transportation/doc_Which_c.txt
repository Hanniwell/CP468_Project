7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer The R33 Skyline is the most widely tuned and used Skyline out there you only have to join Skyline forums to see the amount of owners,which is great as it provides with many aftermarket parts from bodykits to make a mass of styles to tuning parts to take the RB engine to different tuning levels with the RB26 seeing well over 1000bhp and the RB25 seeing 1000bhp. Owning a Skyline is not what it is but what it can become,the car is already great with a super advanced handling setup even now not seen in most cars all this and detuned engines which with any Skyline and what makes them and there engines a tuners dream is the little mods to big power gains and being in such a strong engine also,so you get a car which has ultimate power and ultimate handling setups. Owning a Skyline is also like owning a 200k car as daily i get people taking pics and vids and my cars pics are in a local garage also as well as some advertising decals from a tuning shop.Yourself will geta smile everytime you drive one. The comment about not living up to its name is only made by people whom have no idea about these cars,again there are a mass of owners. Local meet to me.

The R32 and R34 are the ones that people like.
A late 60's Mustang is cool no matter what, and can be upgraded and modified about 100x better than a Skyline. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post GiveMeACookie 1 decade ago Skyline is better than a mustang. Sadly skyline costs more than the mustang. 0 1 1 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago You are stoooopid if you buy a car like that, have you any idea how much they will cost to operate and maintain.
You should by a 3 year old Honda, and use the rest as a downpayment on a house. If you are going to be dumb you should be dumb in the Nissan, way better than the Mustang 0 0 3 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer.

5 1 decade ago american muscle or nothing. and if you're going to get a 67 be sure it's got a CJ in it. if it wasn't origionally made in america it ain't worth buying. and i'd go with a 67 stang over any imported vehilce period the end. the 67 would be my advise. 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Harley Drive Lv
