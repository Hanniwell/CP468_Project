9 years ago Porsche Cayenne vs. BMW X5? Deciding which to buy. Prices is not an issue. V8 in the Cayenne, straight 6 turbo charged diesel in the X5. Panoramic sunroofs in both. Premium sound systems in both. Leather in both. AWD in both. Which will have better resale value? Which do you like better and why? Will be using it for all purposes (in town, highway, long trips, mountain driving,etc.). Thanks for your opinions! :D Answer Save 5 Answers Relevance Anonymous 9 years ago Favorite Answer Cayenne!

6 9 years ago i would go porsche but have you considered the audi Q7 with the S line?
Car and driver or road and track cant remember which one had a comparrision test not too long ago between 5 of these and the audi got the top spot.
It has the same V-6 in the audi S5 putting out 333 horses and it gets pretty good gas mileage. i would personally atleast take the audi for a test drive. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 9 years ago i would personally go with the cayenne as i think the x5's look dated now due to the x6 and u cant beat the sound of a porsche v8 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?
