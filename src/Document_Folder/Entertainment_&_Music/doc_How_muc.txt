7 7 years ago Favorite Answer In his work with Rush from the '70s to today, Alex Lifeson has redefined the boundaries of progressive rock guitar. Embodying far more than that genre label often implies, Lifeson's playing soars beyond the drama and the bluster to reveal truly stunning virtuosity that has been praised and admired by fansâ€”and playersâ€”of all stripes, and has landed him in the upper echelon of performance artists as a result.
In addition to its traditional Les Paul tonewoods, the Alex Lifeson Les Paul Axcess carries two high-output humbucking pickups with series/parallel wiring options via its push-pull volume controls series/parallel options on its push-pull volume controls, and a Floyd Rose licensed unit that not only provides the world's most efficient vibrato system, but is also loaded with GraphTech Ghost piezo bridge saddles. Access traditional Gibson magnetic humbucker tones, mix it up with fat and funky series/parallel options, tap the Ghost's realistic acoustic tones, or blend acoustic and magnetic voicesâ€”the sky's the limit from this sonic chameleon, whose sound-shifting depths are virtually limitless. Whatâ€™s more, you can route it all through a traditional mono jack (labeled â€œRegularâ€) using a single guitar cable, or use two cables to split your sonic trickery off into separate output paths using the â€œRegularâ€ and the â€œLife-O-Soundâ€ output jacks together.
All this, and the Alex Lifeson Les Paul Axcess still presents that timeless Les Paul look that has remained a classic for more than 50 years, in your choice of two stunning colorsâ€”Viceroy Brown and Royal Crimsonâ€”both approved by the artist himself, and both resplendent atop a stunningly figured maple top.
The first 50 guitars in this special run (25 in each finish) will be signed by the artist himself, with unsigned models to follow, so reserve yours now at your authorized Gibson dealer.
According to Gibson's website the guitar will come in two finishes (retailed at $6,115) and 25 of these guitars will be signed by the guitarist himself (retailed around $9,000). This will be a must have for all Rush fans and guitar enthusiasts alike. 0 1 1 Login to reply the answers Post Mark 7 years ago $4,000 at Guitar Center, who advertises having the lowest prices 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
