7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer How about Barbi? Use a last name that brings the two together in a way that will make the listeners/fans remember. Think in terms of Billie Holliday. Her name is instantly recognizable to people who have never heard one song by her. 0 2 0 Login to reply the answers Post Ra GS Lv
5 1 decade ago RaGS sez : Yes! But Barbie is better. It makes you sound like "a real doll" but Bobbie makes you sound like a British police officer, and Barbara makes you sound like Streisand. I'd try to stay away from names like Ralph, Henry or Pedro, however, under ALL circumstances. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Imagine <3 1 decade ago barbie. bobbie sounds like your australian. 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
