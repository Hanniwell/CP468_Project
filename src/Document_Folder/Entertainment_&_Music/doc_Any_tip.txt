7 years ago Any tips on my juggling? I can juggle 3 balls about 6-7 times but the balls always end up touching each other in the air or the balls fly all over the place!! ITS SO ANNOYING. I have learned this in about 1 hour of practice total. Maybe I just need to practice more. Please give some suggestions of how I could fix these! Thank You Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Nick 7 years ago Favorite Answer I don't know what you're using to juggle but I started out using my balled up socks and I got it down in about thirty minutes.
I would try finding different balls with a lighter weight, maybe tennis balls, and keep practicing, it makes perfect. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
