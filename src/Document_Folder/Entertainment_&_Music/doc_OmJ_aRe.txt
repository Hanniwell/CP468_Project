7 1 decade ago Good way to attract attention though, I was here ready to flame! Clayman's always a good start.
It's my favourite album and it has some kick-*** songs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCvq8VN9owY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-744BG0kEI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrSkhiKPFyk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWC0ks1VnD0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23ui51j9M2g The runners up would be The Jester Race or Come Clarity.
Both great albums in their own way.
The Jester Race is full-on Melodic Death Metal while Come Clarity explores other genres, such as Alternative Metal or (*gasps*) Metalcore. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post fugere Lv
