1 decade ago Is there someplace where i can watch this movie on the net for free???????????????? I wanna watch ths movie really bad and i was wondering if i could watch it on the net someplace for FREE! It is called "Ong-bak". If this is possible i would love to know where and how. I searched for it on Limewire but nothing happens. Please help! tanx, Drew. Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance Dutchrub 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Good answer, whatdoitypehere! If you're interested in downloading it, you can find it at isohunt.com. Incidentally, you can find almost anything at isohunt. You will see a torrent file for whatever you're searching for. Download the file (it'll take a second). Make sure you have torrent software. I recommend uTorrent. Double-click the downloaded file from isohunt. It will open uTorrent and start downloading. FYI, isohunt and torrents are the absolute best way to get movies, music, software, games, whatever you want. Limewire is a last resort for me. You're guaranteed to get most whatever you want, AND it's fast, easy, and doesn't take up all your memory while downloading. USE IT! ;) A side note: Ong Bak is an AWESOME film. The things Tony Jaa can do with his body entirely free from strings and special effects astound the mind. It's a really great film. Source(s):
