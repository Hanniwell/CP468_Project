4 4 years ago The teaching received by JWs is the same the world over. All talks from the platform must conform to Society teaching. All public talks must be given from a Society outline (that is so exhaustive it leaves little room for anything else). Even answers given by JWs to questions from the platform must agree with what the Society has printed. No deviation from Society teaching is tolerated. The control exercised from headquarters is so strict that anyone holding to a differing belief on any point would either have to shut up and put up, or leave the organization. This uniformity, which JWs boast about publicly, is not biblical, as even a cursory reading of the New Testament shows. Paul said there were many 'disputable matters' that should not be argued over. The Watchtower Society tolerates no dispute about anything. Christian denominations agree solidly on the foundational, important doctrines of the faith, but they respect others distinctives. Cultural differences are also absorbed in healthy Christian circles. But if any JW disagrees about anything, he dare not voice it publicly, so the real answer to your Q is, 'Yes, but only publicly.' 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post the smartical one 1 decade ago a guy is stuck in a room it has 4 walls and no doors or windows.
