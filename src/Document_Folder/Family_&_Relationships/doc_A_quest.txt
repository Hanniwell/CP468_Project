1 decade ago A question about a guy friend of mine....? If a guy friend seems to act the same around all his girl pals but most of my friends say that we flirt the most, does that mean anything? Like, if he's sitting beside two of his friends and then I step in front of him and he moves over saying: "sit by me" does that mean anything? Or if I just go up to him and he's like: "________(<---------my name here)!" with his arms out and then I hug him and he's like "YAY!" lol. I'm so confused and depressed. Someone help me!!! ^^ Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance Spidergurl Lv
