7 years ago Moving out from home? I'm 16, and life at home for me is horrible. I'm thinking of moving out to friends house but the problem is I can't pick up the guts to do so. I can't even ask my friend. She has told me if I ever need a break from home, her family is willing to take me in, but I haven't acted up on it. Please help! Why can't I do it? How can I do it? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Yosh! 7 years ago Favorite Answer Depends what you mean by your life at home being horrible. If there's abuse, and I mean like serious unjustified physical/mental/environmental abuse, then by all means do go, look for help, etc.
Now if it's minor and due to family customs/culture, think really hard about it before you do decide. I wanted to move out all throughout high school as I was sick of my lifestyle and ahem *crap* that I had to deal with at home.I didn't move out though because I do know that from the bottom of their hearts, my family did care about me and were only looking out for me. Now if your parents aren't buying you something you want or aren't letting you stay out late, that's no reason. If they're really strict, well, it's still not a reason, unless it's affecting your health. I mean, it sucks, but you gotta suck it up.
You don't provide a lot of information so it's really hard to say. I can only give you vague answers, but I understand this is a sensitive topic. I guess my primary overall answer would be: Yes IF: whoever you're staying with is really okay with it, and I mean long term(more than a few days) okay (bonus if you can help with housework or rent)///there is clear and present dangers to your physical or mental health, **or if by staying home your possibilities/options become limited** No else wise. If it's just annoying living with them, then that is no reason. Parents are parents. Their house, their rules. Just do your best to make the best out of it.
Now the ** reason ** is controversial. If they don't want you to pursue something you really want to do or are forcing you to do something you don't want to, that may be a reason depending on the severity. Let's say you want to become a veterinarian but they want to push you into running their business or something that you really oppose, then I would first try to talk it out with them as much as possible before choosing to leave in order to pursue your own dream(really really gotta think about it though). If they don't like how you're dressing and are forcing you to wear something else, I wouldn't consider it a good enough of a reason to move out. Yes freedom of expression, but no it's not life threatening though I would say it's suppressing creativity. It can be talked out, or just wait until you're out of highschool and in college/working. Then you can choose to do whatever you want. All in all, really think about it if it's not something life threatening or damaging in the long run 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post anon Lv
7 7 years ago If there is abuse going on you need to pack a bag and leave it at your friends house to have an escape route.
Also if younger siblings are being abused and someones life is in danger you need to a teacher at school and have them contact social services.
Also pack a bag for any younger siblings including at least two outfits with underwear and socks and keep that at your friends too social services should be able to help them go back for favorite stuff like teddy bear etc.
I have included a link to a site that has more information on how to escape. Source(s):
