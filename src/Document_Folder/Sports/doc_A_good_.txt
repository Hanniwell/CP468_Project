4 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Dear Kalim, I found this good tribute song for Kazakhstan: In my country there is problem, And that problem is transport. It take very very long, Because Kazakhstan is big. Chorus 1 Throw transport down the well (repeat line) So my country can be free (repeat line) We must make travel easy (repeat line) Then we’ll have a big party (repeat line) It has interesting guitar chords, and, became quite popular in Arizona. The you-tube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb3IMTJjzfo Hope you enjoy it. Rehman 0 2 1 Login to reply the answers Post Scientific Cricketer Lv
4 1 decade ago "Stand up for the Champions" is a excellent song by "Right Said Fred". Amazing song if you want to tribute to something.
I have seen many Pakistanis and Indians use this song to make videos about their countries cricket. It is not excactly hip-hop styled, but it is a good song. The youtube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdhQDc05Ud8 Try this link as well;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_EetBChHLk The music used in that video was "Space and Time", by 009 Sound System. You don't need to upload it; the audioswap contains this music on youtube.
A link for purely the music is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt8IAZAX3eM It contains contents from "NatoArts", if you click on that link right below the description, you may notice other great tribute songs. I suggested this song because I have seen people use it on cricket topics. Source(s):

5 1 decade ago I agree with Dan, c'mon Aussie c'mon just feels like cricket. But if your not an Aussie fan. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5xm3F-s6xE Dreadlock Holiday is a great song. It's another song that just feels like cricket in the sun. I love this song. lyrics: 'I don't like cricket, Oh no, I love it'. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post ? Lv

6 1 decade ago This will go along with the video just fine: Creed - Sacrifice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMMpy81xInc &feature=fvst or James Blunt - 1973 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAq0AbxhawI or
James Blunt - So Long Jimmy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_WM72BRzQ0 (If you are retiring lol) or Gold Spot - Float On (The OC Remix) Source(s):
The song will depend on the type of video. Couldn't think of anything better at this moment. There are so many songs spinning in my head lol.
Btw, note that Youtube versions of these songs suck. They are a lot better than they sound on Youtube. 0 1 1 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago Aage aage dula chale pecchye choro ki barat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
