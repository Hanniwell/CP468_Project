6 7 years ago Favorite Answer Instructor.
The head instructor at my dojo is one of the highest graduated in my country, he has trained, graduated and instructed with the best instructors in the world including Morio Higoanna (who offered him a position as assistant instructor).
Goju Ryu and Kyokushin karate have some really awesome instructors in my country. Price is quite low just around 20 dollars per month for about 3-5 sessions a week of 1Â½ hour plus open dojo on off days. The instructors are all volunteers and have normal jobs on the side. 0 2 0 Login to reply the answers Post Paul Lv
