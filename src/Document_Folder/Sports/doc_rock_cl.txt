1 decade ago rock climbing instructor? Hey i was wondering what courses and certification you need to work at a climbing wall and what the pay is like Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Cody Lv
6 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Working at a climbing wall does not require any special certification.
Often gyms will train their own instructors as they see fit.
To be truly certified, you would need to complete the AMGA program to be a "Certified Wall Instructor".
This is the lowest certification they offer, but it is more than most climbing wall instructors go through.
See the flowchart and program outline below... http://amga.com/images/misc_PDFs/Program_Flow_Char... http://amga.com/programs/climbing_wall_instructor.... If you have a gym in mind, just go and ask what you need to do to work there...and as for pay...probably pretty close to minimum wage. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
