7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer You can buy replacement cords for the poles. It's handy to keep some with you when you go camping. Ask in any camping shop or outdoor sports store for tent pole shock cord. Here is how to repair broken poles,
hook the end of the old cord out and replace the cord with a new one. http://www.trails.com/how_24500_shock-corded-fiber...

. . . . To clean a tent turn it inside out give it a good shake and wipe it all over with a soft cloth and warm soapy water, not detergent unless it's a specialised one for cleaning proofed nylon like the Nikwax tent cleaner. Let it dry and turn it the right way out again then do the outside the same way as the inside.
For muddy areas you can use a spray jet on a hose pipe water pistol
with the tent hanging over a washing line or similar, and brush it off with a soft brush. Rinse the tent
with the hose pipe spray and let it dry thoroughly, then turn it inside out again to let the inside dry once more in case of wetting from cleaning the outside.
Make sure the whole tent is completely
dry before folding it into the valise. For very badly soiled tents, put the whole tent into a large tub or bath of warm soapy water or use the Nikwax tent cleaner mentioned above.
Swish it round, let it soak, swish it some more, until the soil is removed. Rinse the tent off in fresh water or take it outside and hose it. If it needs another wash repeat the same thing over. Some soil marks won't come out anyway. You can buy tent reproofing solutions you can paint on or spray on to use when the tent has been cleaned and dried. Nikwax tent proofer
and Fabsil waterproofer can be bought at DIY stores and in camping and outdoor sports shops. Washing the inside panels for large tents. http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=200...
