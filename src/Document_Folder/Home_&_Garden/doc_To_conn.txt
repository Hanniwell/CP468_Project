1 decade ago To connect my 120v/L5-30a to the 3500w generator, why not a
ul1449 surge suppressor? Instead of inserting two 15a circuit breakers in a separate box, why not a
ul1449 surge suppressor (for my peak/running 13a/2a freezer, 11a/5a
frig, 21a/8.3a oil heating and fan)? Am I right to say: 1-transformer reduces volts 2-circuit breaker reduces amps, breaks over-volts and protects wires 3- surge suppressor breaks over-volts and protects equipments? Can I connect a normal male plug extension directly into the 20a female output of my generator for the 3 equipments above: ( 20a is not much than 30a, and no additional breaker in-between, while the generator has already its 30a/20a breakers)?

6 1 decade ago Favorite Answer You need to safely limit current in your 15A circuits.
To do this a fuse or circuit breaker is needed.
The L5-30 outlet will supply 120VAC at up to 30 amps.
Direct connection to a 15A outlet will not provide adequate over current protection. The surge suppressor is used to help protect devices against short high voltage spikes on the line.
It isn't a bad idea to install.
If it is built into a power bar with a built in circuit breaker it may the over current protection needed.
(The circuit breaker, not the surge suppressor will be supplying the protection.) Source(s):

4 1 decade ago I'm struggling to understand some of your terminologies, but I understand enough to know your theories are incorrect. 20 am is indeed much less than 30 amps especially at 220 volt.
6600 watts @ 220v 3600 watts @ 120v.
That's a considerable difference. A transformer can reduce the voltage yes. A circuit breaker does not reduce amps. A surge protector protects equipment from surges, not from over loading. I would strongly suggest you connect your loads to this generator according to local codes and manufacturer recommendations. Good luck. http://www.rickdoan.com Source(s):
