8 years ago How do I make a full wall into a half wall? I have a small 4th bedroom on the second floor of our house.
It's an oddly shaped room and I want to open up the two walls that border the stairwell to make it like a loft room.
I would replace the walls with a railing.
I don't think the walls are load bearing but I'm not sure.
How do I get started on a project like this?
