7 years ago How to get rid of burdock's? I have tons of burdock's at my home, and I can't seem to get rid of them. I have pulled them out to the roots, cut them, put weed stuff on them. Any help to get these things gone for good, would be great. Thanks Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Anonymous 7 years ago Favorite Answer Try this trick.
For starts, cut the bottom off a 2 liter soda bottle and remove the cap and put over the plant and spray into the bottle.
For large ones, cut off close to the ground and PAINT the stump until it is wet with the weed killer.
I recommend "round up". Source(s):
I deal with weeds quite often with excellent results. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
