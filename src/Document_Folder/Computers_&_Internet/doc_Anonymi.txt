7 7 years ago Favorite Answer How can you guarantee that a VPN service dos not keep a log? Most do, and will turn the log over to authorities when asked. Since there is no way to know, Tor is about the best we have for anonymity. VPN and the SOCKS5 protocol may be secure but its not anonymous. Do not use the Tor bundle on your OS that you use every day. There are too many things on your computer that will compromise your anonymity. The US government have been exploiting flaws in Windows and Firefox. For true anonymity use either Liberte Linux or TAILS on a usb and boot into it. http://dee.su/liberte https://tails.boum.org/ 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Kendra 4 years ago 2 Source(s):

You should give VIP72 a shot, they are very good proxies and provide a very easy setup. Heres a link if you wanna give them a shot, the file includes a login :) http://adf.ly/j0Ybg 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?
