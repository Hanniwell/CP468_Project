7 years ago How do I 'subtract' in photoshop? In this photoshop colourization tutorial,
http://www.worth1000.com/tutorials/161018/tutorial it talks about subtracting objects from a selected area- in this case, nose, eyes, mouth, etc from the persons face.
I don't understand how to do this, and I've tried to find another tutorial to help me. I keep selecting the skin I want, but I can't figure out how to exclude features like eyes and stuff.
Can anyone please try to explain? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Pink Donut Lv
5 7 years ago Favorite Answer use a tool like the polygonal lasso tool to trace them. but since you already traced the skin area, you need to use the "subtract from selection" option for the tool. its the third box you have to select here: http://etutorials.org/shared/images/tutorials/tuto... you lasso will have a negative symbol (-) by it to let you know you are in subtraction mode a shortcut is to hold down the alt key when you have your tool in regular selection mode. it will turn it into subtraction mode. alternatively, holding down shift will turn it into addition mode. try it out and notice the add and subtract symbols on the tools when you do it 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Joseph Stephen 7 years ago put them in layers and change the top layer mode to difference. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
