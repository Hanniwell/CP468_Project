6 years ago What is the meaning of this Bo Burnham poem? Convenience
I would do anything for you,
if convenient. I would move a mountain for you if that mountain could be moved with a button or a lever that wasn't too cold to the touch I would give you the moon if I could. You would love the moon. You would show it off to everyone and not give a **** that you've now severely damaged our ecosystem by disrupting the tides. Maybe a nice look in the mirror is in order, Missy.
***I really like this poem for some reason, but I'm not sure what the meaning is. I always struggle with interpreting poems. Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated!**** Update : p.s. where it's starred out, it's supposed to say f**k. Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance Stan1951 Lv
