9 years ago Help with Jack Kerouac's Mexico City Blues- 2nd Chorus? I believe that I have a fairly solid understanding of this whole stanza but there is one part that I'm not too sure about. The very last 4 lines: "Snakes are Poor Denizens of Hell Have come surreptitioning Through the tall grass To face the pool of clear frogs." If you could help me understand a little better it would be very much appreciated! Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance ~~*Milieu*~~ Lv
