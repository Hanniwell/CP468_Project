1 decade ago Terms from Kerouac's 'On the Road'? Does anyone know what the term "Ballin' the jack" means?
It's used for driving.
I think it has something to do with 'flooring it' but I'm not sure. Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance braennvin2 Lv
5 1 decade ago Favorite Answer It was a song and a dance based on that song in 1913. It was also a term used by railroad workers to mean the train was going at top speed, so "flooring it" is pretty close. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
