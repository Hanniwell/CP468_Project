10 years ago Jack Kerouac fans help? So I've just gotten into Jack Kerouac books and I've read The Road, Big Sur and The Dharma Buma.
Needless to say I am in love and need more.
Could you recommend which of his books I should read next?
He has written so much that I just wanted some opinions from people who know his stuff and about which of his books are your favourites (aside from the ones already mentioned).
Also I love non-fiction as well so if you have read something written by him that isn't a novel please tell me about that too! Update : ? that site was just nothing...
