Lock and Key
Just Listen - Annabel Greene is the youngest of three very different sisters.
She has had a very bad summer and must now return to school.
She has never been so lonely or so sad, yet she must face each day.
As she has her own problems to confront, her entire family is dealing with issues that plague her sister, Whitney.
By circumstance, Annabel and Owen, who life revolves around music, become friends.
It is Owen who will help Annabel to meet certain challenges.
The Truth About Forever - Macy's father has recently died and she is feeling guilty.
Her mother isn't coping with his death well at all.
Macy's boyfriend, Jason, represents security, but frankly he is a clueless jerk.
It might have been a very long summer, but then by chance Macy meets an interesting group of people.
Dreamland - Caitlin is the younger and she feels second-rate sister to Cass who is perfect in every way.
Now Caitlin is 16 and rather than starting at Yale, Cass has run off with a guy.
This year for Caitlin is about school, cheerleading, parties, her boyfriend, and so much much more.
Keeping the Moon - Colie and her mother used to be fat.
They moved frequently and were homeless for a time.
Then Colie's mother went on a "let's get healthy" kick and they both lost weight.
Now mom has a good job and they live in a nice house.
Unfortunately, because of a really mean girl at school, Colie has acquired a reputation she did not deserve.
Mom is going to Europe to work for the summer and Colie is going to spend the summer with her eccentric aunt.
That Summer - Summers hold special memories for many of us:
vacations, beaches, picnics, summer jobs, summer loves, maybe even a wedding or two.
Haven, younger sister to Ashley, is fondly remembering a summer five years ago because in this current summer her world is falling apart.
Someone Like You - Halley and Scarlet, both 16 and juniors in high school, have been best friends forever.
Scarlet was always the strong one, but now she needs Halley to be there for her.
Meanwhile Halley has problems of her own.
This Lullaby - Remy, Jess, Chloe, and Lissa are friends (sort of) and now it is the summer between high school and college.
This is a time of transition for each of them, but the story concentrates on Remy who because her mother has had a series of husbands and Remy never even met her father, she is very cynical about love. Ann Brashares:
The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants - A wonderful story about Tibby, Carmen, Lena, and Bridget, four very different friends who are spending their first summer apart from one another.
Each of the girls faces her own crisis and, in the end, they are there for each other.
It's a great story of friendship.

4 4 years ago I guess it really all depends on what type of books you like. I haven't heard of any of those honestly, but if you like mystery books, there's Premonitions by Jude Watson which has a sequel. My favorite series was by Hunter Morgan, and it starts with She'll Never Know. It's not necessarily a teen series, but definitely captivating. Another good book was Hawksong, which also has a sequel. If you're looking for just plain, quick and easy to read books that you can just sit and read on the beach, TTYL is a good book, by Lauren Myracle. Sonya Sones is also a pretty good author, there are things that people can definitely relate to. Cecily von Ziegesar is my favorite teen author. She wrote the Gossip Girl series and the It Girl series. Both of which are really good. And anything by Hailey Abbott and Kate Brian are pretty good. Oh, and the book Leftovers was really good. It kept my attention. Hope that helps. :] 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago The Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer The Noughts and Crosses Trilogy by Malorie Blackman The Mediator Series by Meg Cabot Happy Reading :) 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post laboheme94 1 decade ago The Clique Series.
