1 decade ago What exactly IS the "homosexual agenda"? This is a phrase I have never quite grasped. I hear a lot of bigoted Christians (both here and outside of Y!A) referring to "the homosexual agenda", and complaining that I am a supporter of it whenever I defend gay people + myself. What the hell is it? What's the agenda? Are there any Christians out there who can clarify what exactly this is supposed to mean? I get asked if I am a supporter of the homosexual agenda, and never quite know, because I've never heard the phrase defined. Update : @ Houston I’m sure you’ll get over it. And Y!A recommended this category, if you’ve got a problem with it
then take it up with them. Answer Save 4 Answers Relevance R[̲̅ə̲̅٨̲̅٥̲̅٦̲̅]ution Lv
7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Bigoted xtians use the "agenda" term as a scare tactic to deflect attention away from their blatant homophobia.
They believe that gays are sinful and immoral (and indeed the bible does say so), and that gays should be treated as such, i.e. as less than equals.
They believe that _tolerating_ homosexuality is no different from endorsing and even encouraging it.
And since it is a sinful act, and because humans have free will to choose to do good or evil, therefore homosexuality is a choice that people make rather than something they're born with.
They see the "homosexual agenda" as an effort to spread acceptance of sinful behavior and liberal politics throughout society. Oh, and it's not just the xtians.
Most every major religion has strict teachings against homosexuality.
(With the possible exception of Buddhism, which is one of those liberal religions anyways. [ <--- tongue-in-cheek] ) Needless to say, as both a libertarian and an atheist, I rather disagree with religion's take on the "gay agenda."
But I think it's important to note the reasons _why_ those xtians hold the views that they do. 0 1 1 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago I think it's a term used by hardline Christians who believe that gay people are trying to "ruin" our society by having laws that help protect their own rights. That term to me - Homosexual Agenda - gives the sound like all gay people are just one massive army and they're trying to overthrow gov't, which I think is absolute ********. 0 2 1 Login to reply the answers Post mom38 1 decade ago referring to advocacy of cultural acceptance and normalization of non-heterosexual orientations and relationships. Efforts referred to by the term include changing government policies regarding LGBT issues — such as same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption, anti-discrimination laws, inclusion of LGBT people in the military, and inclusion of LGBT history and issues in public education — as well as non-governmental campaigns and individual actions to increase visibility and cultural acceptance of LGBT people, relationships, and identities.
Here is what I found.
Seems to me that the "homosexual agenda" is just asking for the same basic human rights everyone else is asking for.
