9 years ago how can courage be built? everyone is born with a different level of courage, but in some places I've read that courage can be built. Answer Save 11 Answers Relevance Anonymous 9 years ago Favorite Answer The first step towards courage... is to acknowledge your fears... There is no point plunging forwards if a wall remains between you and your goal. Your next step, is to understand your fears, and make it seem logical... and eventually learn how to slowly unravel it... to untie one by one the knots that remained tangled within to prevent you from feeling doubt... second thoughts. It slowly poisons you... doubt. Build confidence... it is the key towards courage. Understand yourself and understand your enemy(yourself), better... be swift, and adapt yourself with your surroundings, not allowing anyone to make you sway. Think logically... take calculated risks... it is foolish to merely plunge blindfolded, when you can choose to have your eyes open. Believe in your decisions, and believe in you.
Slowly a feeling comes to your hands... you've your fate there. Cheers!!! 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post meme 9 years ago To speculate and trade with the stock market, learn how courage is so easily defeated by confidence,

By taking risks.... if you step outside your comfort zone and are successful you are more likely to be rush into failure before understanding why success is so difficult: many hours of intense mental and physical labor...
Sorry, there is no sort-cut, that is how courage is built.
