7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Not anymore, but I have before.
I found it to be a good experience and it certainly made the transition to "big brother" easier for my son. Check out the book, "Adventures in Tandem Nursing" by Hilary Flower. http://www.nursingtwo.com 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Jovi's Mama 1 decade ago No, i'm not. I'm not even breastfeeding but for some reason i admire someone who tandem feeds. It was hard for me to breastfeed one child but to feed 2 children at once is a feat. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post alecnaaron 1 decade ago No..are you nursing childen of a different ages or twins?
