1 decade ago Basic Instrumentation Calibration? I'm given readings from an instrument and for each one in point form im suppose to describe the correct calibration procedure to correct the errors.
I've done the worksheet, but just want to make sure my last two are correct. true pressure input

true pressure output#1
| true pressure output #2 0................

.................102...............
.......................101.5 100................
.................112.............
..........................112 those are two different charts but they both have same inputs of course so i just put them together to save space the answers are only dealing with span, zero's, and angularity for bother charts to correct the errors i got -zero -span -zero -angularity -zero -span -zero i believe thats the corrections needed for both, can anyone else confrim this? thanks!

7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer The first set of data requires span and offset correction, only.
A linear regression gives a formula: y = 1.0944x + 3.1349 with an R^2 of 0.9999 The second set of data requires all 3 (span, offset, and angularity) corrections.
A polynomial regression shows a formula of: y = -0.0009x^2 + 1.1873x + 1.869
with an R^2 value of 1 . 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post ? Lv
4 4 years ago various of of diverse motives. - stigma is related to it. - it relatively is not any longer something yet logical technological wisdom. some are sturdy at it, some are no longer. - it particularly is generally no longer taught(or learnt) in relaxing way. So vast aversion is more suitable from the very commencing up - if with the aid of unavoidable circumstances, a youthful pupil ignored a type, that step of positive judgment keeps to be a vulnerable link. it particularly is almost a ladder, while between the commencing up steps isn't sturdy, each and each step upwards makes the full lader greater shaky and wobbly; finally it gets frightening - slowly it expands in diverse fields like algebra, geometry, calculus etc. The good judgment of one is going into yet another etc and so on. So, one vulnerable concept impacts the full shape. it particularly is diverse than historic previous, languages - the place each and each subgroup do no longer impact one yet another as plenty. - initially it variety of feels boring and repetitive, to that end no longer well worth taking activity in. - the tension of the form does no longer enable any slip/weak spot. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
