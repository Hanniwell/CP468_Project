1 decade ago Math Degisn Question.? a swimming pool is to be 50 m by 21 m. The deep end if 4.0 m deep and extends out 12 m. The shallow end is 1.2 m deep and extends out 12 m. There is a uniform slope connecting the deep and shallow ends. a)Calculate the cost of filling the pool with water as $2.00 per m3. b)Waterproofing of the underwater surfaces costs $17’m2. Determine the cost of waterproofing. Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Kathleen K Lv
7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer The pool is really a prism with polygonal bases on the two vertical sides of the pool
This base is key to answering your questions.
The base is made up of (draw your own diagram from left to right):
LEFT: a rectangle 4m high, 12m wide MIDDLE: a trapezoid with bases drawn vertically of 4m and 1.2m and height 26m. (the bases of this trapezoid connect up to the 4m height of the rectangle to the right and the 1.2m height of the rectangle to the left) RIGHT: a rectangle 1.2m high, 12 m wide Totalling up the areas of this polygon = 48 + 67.6 + 14.4 = 130m² = Base Area. (a) The volume of a prism is Base Area * height = 130*21 = 2730m³ ===> $5,460 b) 3 vertical sides of shallow end = 45(1.2) = 54 bottom of shallow end = 12(21) = 262 3 vertical sides of deep end = 45(4) = 180 flat bottom of deep end = 12(21) = 262 2 trapezoidal sides of middle section connecting deep and shallow ends:
26(4+1.2) = 135.2 Floor of sloped part connecting deep and shallow ends = 26.15(21) = 549.16 Total surface area = 1442.36m²*$17/m² = $24.520.12 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Davis P Lv
7 1 decade ago This is not a hard question, but it is tedious The sides of the pool look like ___________________________ |..............................................| |...................................______| |...................... |____ The pool has three sections 1) Shallow:
_ area = 12m x 1.2 m = 14.4 m^2
_ vol = 14.4 m^2 * 21m = 302.4 m^3 2) Deep _ area = 12m x 4m = 48 m^2 _ vol = 48m^2 * 21m = 1008 m^3 3) transition _ area = (50-12-12)*( (1.2) +1/2(4- 1.2)) = 67.6 m^2 _ vol = 67.6 m^2 * 21 m = 1496.6 m^3 a) Total volume = 1496.6 + 1008 +302.4 = 2730m^3 at $2 per m^3 it cost $5,460 to fill b)
the area of a side (two of these) is sa = 14.4 +
48 + 76.6 = 130m^2 The area of the shallow end sha = 1.2 m * 21m = 25.2 m^2 area of deep end dpa = 4 m * 21m = 48 m^2 area of deep bottom
dpb = 12m * 21 m = 252 m^2 area of shallow bottom shb = 12m * 21 m = 252 m^2 area of transition bottom
length of transition bottom is sqrt( (50-12-12)^2 +(4-1.2)^2) = 26.150 m trb = 26.150 m * 21 m = 549.15 m^2 total surface area = 1422.35 m^2 Waterproofing at $17 per m^2 = $24,179.95 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
