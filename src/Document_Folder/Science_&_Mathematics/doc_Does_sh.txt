1 decade ago Does shale erode more easily than sandstone?? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Yes.
Shale is made up of smaller particles than a sandstone, and each particle is more strongly bonded to each other in sandstone.
Also, the minerals that make up shale are stacked like paper sheets, and can easily slide past each other, falling apart during weathering.
Sand particles have no such weakness. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago no.. sandstone is sand... u can break it easily... shale has some strength ... not much but a
