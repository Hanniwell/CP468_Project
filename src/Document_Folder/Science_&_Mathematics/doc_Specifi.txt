7 years ago Specific Heat of Water? Calculate the final temperature, in degrees Celcius, when 45.0 g of water, initially at 20.7 °C, absorbs 3560 J of heat. Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance Anonymous 7 years ago Favorite Answer Mass X Change in Temperature (ΔT) X Specific Heat (SH) = Heat This is what we know: 45.0 g X
(? final - 20.7 °C initial) X 4.184 J/1 cal = 3560 J Divide the heat (3560J) by the mass (45 grams) times the amount of joules in one gram of water (4.184J/g H20) (3560J) / (45.0 g X 4.184 J) = 18.91 18.91°C is the result of the final subtracted by the initial. To test this add 18.91°C
to 20.7°C.
18.91°C + 20.7°C = 39.61°C 39.61°C is the answer. If you want to check yourself plug it back in the beginning equation: 45.0 g X
(39.61°C final - 20.7°C initial) X 4.184 J/1 cal = 3560 J equals: 45g X 18.91°C X 4.184J/1cal = 3560.3748 J or
3560 J Thus, the answer 39.61°C is indeed correct. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 7 years ago To answer we must be given the specific heat of water, which a quick google search shows is 4.186 joule/gram °C. We use the equations: Q=mc(delta T) Where Q is enthalpy
M = mass C = specific heat
delta T = change in temp Then we plug and chug: 3560j=(45g)(4.186 joule/gram °C)(Tf-20.7) Tf=39.59 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
