10 years ago AKS factoring algorithm in python (really challenging program)? I need an AKS factoring algorithm in python that stores the prime powers and not just the primes for e.g. AKSfactor(25)=[5^2]
AKSfactor(100)=[5^2,2^2]
AKSfactor(10)=[5,2] AKSfactor(36)=[3^2,2^2] Update : actually can be any good factoring algorithm! Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance siamese_scythe Lv
7 10 years ago Favorite Answer AKS is an algorithm for deciding whether a given integer is prime or composite; when composite is returned, information about the factors is not provided. So AKS only gives factorization when the number we are testing happens to be prime. What algorithm you decide to use for integer factorization depends mostly on how large the integers are and how fast you need the algorithm to run; other considerations are how much effort you need to program it, and how much memory you have available on your system. Here is a good overview of available algorithms. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization You should give more information about how large the integers are and how fast you need the algorithm to be, in order to get useful answers. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
