7 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Your second statement doesn't fit, but the rest sounds like it might be a description of an antlion:
http://www.worsleyschool.net/science/files/antlion... These aren't ants, but a relative of lacewings.
They're predators (why the part about them burying plants in their holes doesn't fit), and when an ant or other crawling insect steps into the mouth of the hole, the sides give way and they slip down the side into the jaws of the waiting antlion.
The plant bits may just be debris that blew into the hole by the wind. It might also be, that if what you saw was an adult winged insect, it could have been an ant in the stage that they do have wings in order for part of the colony to disperse.
Ands live more in mounds with holes in the center, and they will chew and carry bits of plant material back to the colony to eat.
