9 years ago fundamental frequency? A stretched wire vibrates in its first normal mode at a frequency of 423 Hz. What would be the fundamental frequency if the wire were one third as long, its diameter were tripled, and its tension were increased four-fold? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance az_lender Lv
7 9 years ago Favorite Answer One way of formulating the fundamental frequency of
a stretched string or wire is f = (1/2L) sqrt(TL/m). In your problem, L is replaced by (1/3)L,
m is presumably replaced by 9m if the density remains the same, and T is increased by 4T. New f = (3/2L) sqrt (4TL/27m) The ratio of the new f to the old f is (3/1) times (2/3) times sqrt(1/3) = 2/sqrt(3) or 1.155 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
