Find fx(2,0) of f (x,y)= In (x^2+y^2) A. √3 B. -1 C. 0 D. 2 E. 1? fx means take the partial derivative of the given with respects to x...treat the y^2 term in this case as a constant...so that means... f(x, y) = ln (x^2 + y^2) Use the chain rule (f(g(x))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x))...take the derivative of the outside function times the derivative of the inside function...use the power rule: d/dx (ax^b) = (a*b)x^(b-1) and that derivative of constants are 0..and that derivative of ln x is 1/x... fx (x, y) = 1/(x^2 + y^2) * d/dx (x^2 + y^2)
fx (x, y) = 1/(x^2 + y^2) * (2x^(2-1) + 0)
fx (x, y) = 2x/(x^2 + y^2)
Now evaluate at (2, 0)...substitute 2 for all x's you see in there and 0 for all y's you see in there.. fx (2, 0) = (2(2))/((2)^2 + (0)^2)
fx (2, 0) = 4/4
fx (2, 0) = 1 <--- answer... Option E. 1. 0 2 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now. Ask Question + 100 Join Yahoo Answers and get 100 points today.
