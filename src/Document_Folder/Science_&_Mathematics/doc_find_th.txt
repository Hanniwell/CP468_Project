of an triangle with hypotenuse of 5.4 and a adjacent of 5. Plz show all work Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Bubbles 8 years ago Favorite Answer If you know the value of the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, you can use the cosine function to solve for theta.
(cos theta = adjacent value / hypotenuse value) Original Equation => cos theta = 5 / 5.4 Solving right side of equation => cos theta = .925 (repeating) Inverse cosine => cos^-1 (cos theta) = cos^-1 (.925)
(make sure you're in degrees mode on your calculator when solving this...otherwise, the answer comes out with radians units, which is wrong when you're looking for an angle in degrees) theta = about 22.2 degrees
Hope this helps! ;D Source(s):
