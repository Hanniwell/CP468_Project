9 years ago Diameter of a corona? For an assignment, I was given a picture of some coronae on venus. http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/arach.jpg
(using this as an example) The question I got was to measure the diameter of one of the corona So then would I measure just from the edges of the rim area, or would I include the fractures when measuring?
