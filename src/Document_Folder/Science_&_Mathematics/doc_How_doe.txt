7 9 years ago Favorite Answer Terminal velocity of a falling object in air? You can use the equation below, but the drag coefficient is difficult to calculate.
The link has more info on the drag coef. terminal velocity Vt = √(2mg/ρACd)
Vt = terminal velocity,
m = mass of the falling object,
g = gravitational acceleration,
Cd = drag coefficient,
ρ = density of the fluid/gas
A = projected area of the object. Source(s):
