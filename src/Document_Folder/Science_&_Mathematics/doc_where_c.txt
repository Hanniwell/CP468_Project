6 1 decade ago Favorite Answer I would try a restaurant supply company; however, should you learn that they don't sell to the public, ask someone at a butcher shop or restaurant if they could obtain one for you to purchase from them. I'm not certain you would locate one in a typical 'home use' store, however, you might want to investigate Williams-Sinoma since they frequently carry specialty items for home 'chefs'. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
