9 years ago A cell has an internal resistance of 0.50 ohms. It has a terminal voltage of 1.4V...? If someone could help me solve this it would be greatly appreciated. I'm thinking I need to find the current, but have no idea how... A cell has an internal resistance of 0.50 ohms. It has a terminal voltage of
1.4V when connected to a 5.0 ohm external resistance. What will its terminal voltage be if the 5.0 ohm resistor is replaced by a 10.0 ohm resistor Answer Save 5 Answers Relevance Anonymous 9 years ago Favorite Answer The terminal voltage, Vt = EMF - voltage lost across the internal resistance, Vr. Vt = EMF - Vr We need to find out what the EMF is, to do that we need to find the current flowing. From Ohms law V = I x R Vt = I x R Where: R is the resistance connected between the terminals of the cell. I=Vt/R I = 1.4/5 I = 0.28A This is the current also flowing through the internal resistance, r since R and r are in series This means that the voltage across r is:
Vr = I x r Vr = 0.28 x 0.5 Vr = 0.14v From: Vt = EMF - Vr Emf = Vt +Vr EMF = 1.4 +0.14 V EMF = 1.54V If a 10 Ohm Resistor is used instead then the current flowing will be: I = EMF/(R +r) So, the voltage, VR across the 10 Ohm resistor (R)
will be the current flowing through it times its value. VR= Emf/(R +r) x R VR= 1.54/(10 +0.5) x 10 VR = 1.4666 V VR = 1.47 V Since the resistance, R
is connected directly to the terminals then VR is also the terminal voltage. New terminal voltage = 1.47V 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Vivek M 9 years ago In both cases, it can be modelled as an ideal EMF, and internal resistance 0.5 ohm in series with the external resistance. The total resistance of the series circuit is simply the sum of the internal and external resistance. The terminal voltage is the current in the series circuit multipled by the external resistance. The current is given by Ohms law applied to the unknown emf and the total series resistance. Use this in the first to find the ideal EMF and then apply it to the second case to find the terminal voltage 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post datta Lv
4 4 years ago i might answer your question different than that evidently suspiciously like question 5 from my electric powered technologies project purely with the resistance values replaced by skill of a million ohm. My question even includes a similar sequence factors for the duration of a parallel connection wording. i might opt to show out that there is no project with the factors in sequence being linked for the duration of something. in case you draw the circuit explanation why will become obvious. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Fazaldin A Lv
7 9 years ago Let,
emf = v volts, then
v*5/(5+0.5) = 1.4
v = 1.4*5.5/5 = 1.54 volts
Now, resistor = 10 ohms
terminal voltage = 1.5 * 10 /(10+0.5) = 1.429 v >=====< ANSWER 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer. Sign in Shamar Y Lv
