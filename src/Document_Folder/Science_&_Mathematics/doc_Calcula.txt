7 years ago Calculate the work done by F.? An object moves along the polygonal path that connects (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) in the order indicated. One of the forces acting on the objects is F (x,y,z) = yzi + xzj + xyk.

∫c ∇(xyz) · dr, since ∇(xyz) = <yz, xz, xy> = F; hence the integral is indep. of path = xyz {from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1)}, by Fund. Theorem of Calculus for line integrals = 1. I hope this helps! 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 4 years ago If you happen to graph the function f(x) = -7, you'll have a horizantal line on y= -7 that suggests, wherever you're on the graph, it is going to at all times have y as -7 Algebraically, if f(x) = -7 then that means the output is continually -7 in spite of enter. That suggests f(0) = -7, f(1) = - 7, f(2) = -7 and f(googolplex) = -7. There is not any rate of exchange. Your answer is -7 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post J Lv
7 7 years ago Just in case Kb did it in this way , If curl F =(0,0,0) exists a potential function G , such as dG = F,dr , so
INT _C F.dr = INT_C dG
= G(b)-G(a)
Curl F = (D/dx, D/dy,D/dz) x (yz,xz,xy ) = (0,0,0) as you see
Since exists G , dG= DG/dx dx+DG/dy dy+DG/dz dz
For finding out G , this can be written as
(DG/dx i+DG/dy j+DG/dz k ) . (dx i+dyj+dzk) = (Fx i+Fyj+Fzk) , (dx i+dyj+dzk)
DG/dx= Fx DG/dy= Fy DG/dz= Fz
In this case,
DG/dx= yz
(1) DG/dy=xz
(2) DG/dz=xy
(3)
From (1)
G= xyz+ h(yz)
DG/dy = xz+ Dh/dy = xz
( From (2))
Dh/dy=0 h= g(z)
So , up to this moment G= xyz +g(z)
DG/dz= xy+dg/dz
From (3)
DG/dz= xy+dg/dz = xy
dg/dz= 0 g= Constant =C Thus , G(x,y,z) = xyz+C
( Potential function )
As you see dG = F.dr Also , you can do the problem directly , as F.dr .- Each line is r(t)= ( x(t),y(t),z(t) ) , so
F.dr = F(x(t),y(t) ,z(t) ) . (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt ) dt 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
