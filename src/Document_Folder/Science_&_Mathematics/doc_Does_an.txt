4 1 decade ago Favorite Answer TALUS - Rock debris accumulated at the base of a cliff by erosion of material from higher elevation. (
http://history.nasa.gov/EP-95/glossary.htm
) "Talus cones are seldom preserved in the sedimentary record because of subsequent erosion. When they are preserved, however, they generally consist of poorly sorted breccias. This particular talus cone empties into a lake in the Sierra Nevada, CA.
The talus cones below are in Banff National Park of Alberta." (
