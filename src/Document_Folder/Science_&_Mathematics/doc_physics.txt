1 decade ago Physics question boggling one? H?ow do
i use the quadratic formula for this? A sports car travel is going 40.0 m/s. It approaches a stationary police car stopped at the side of the road. When the sports car is still 210 m from
the police car, the police car accelerates at 3.0 m/s2.
How long will it take the sports car to pass the police car? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance nobigger120 Lv
4 1 decade ago Favorite Answer draw a picture and label some point (it doesn't matter where its a pic, as there meeting point. label the distance from the sports car to the police car as 210 then label the distance from the point where they meet to the sportscar as 210-x where x is the distance traveled by the sports car (after the 210 m away point) do the same for the police car, but do 210-y so 210-x= y and 210-y= x.
the **** for the police car is vi= 0 m/s a= 3 m/s2 d=y or 210-x the **** for the sports car is vi= 40 m/s a=0 and d= x or 210-y set up two equations which solve for time for the police car do d=vit + 1/2at^2 so you get 210-x= 1/2(3)t^2 for the sports car do d= vit + 1/2at^2 or x= 40t
now substitute in the 40t for x you get 210-40t=1.5t^2 do 1.5t^2 +40t -210 =0 and use quadratic formula to solve for t
then plug t into x=40t and you know then how much to subtract from 210 to get the point where they meet 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Prιηcεss Zεldα Lv
6 1 decade ago x2 = x1 +v1t + 1/2(at^2) 0m = -210m + (40m/s)t +(1.5m/s^2)t^2 a = -210 b = 40 c = 1.5 Use these values for quadratic equation 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
