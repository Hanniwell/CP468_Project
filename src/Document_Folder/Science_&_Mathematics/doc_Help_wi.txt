1 decade ago Help with earthworms (aka Phylum Annelida)?!!!? okay so i have this stupid biology 11 lab about earthworms and i cant seem to find the answers to certain questions. and i dont know alot of people in my class so i cant ask for help here are the questions i cant solve: (even if you only know one, thats better than nothing) 2. Why is it importnat for the skin of the earthworm to remain moist at all times? 4. Describe the LOCATION and POSITION of the setae.
How do they aid in locomotion? 6. What did you find inside the crop, gizzard and intestines? 7. Describe the function and direction of blood flow of the following structures: aortic arches, ventral vessel, dorsal vessel.
How are the dorsal and ventral blood vessels connected elsewhere besides the aortic arches? 10. Describe the major parts of a nephridium and how it works. (i know how it works, i just dont know the major parts) 11. Describe the structures and functions of the earthworm's two nervous systems. ANY help with any of those questions would be VERY helpful thankyou xox Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance kt Lv

Earthworms (Annelida) do not have specialized respiratory surfaces, instead exchange of gases occurs across the body surface.
In order for gas to diffuse, it must be dissolved in water.
thus, the skin must remain moist in order for gas exchange to occur.
( http://www.mcwdn.org/Animals/Earthworms.html) 4.
Four setae can be found on the ventral surface of each metamere.
They provide traction during locomotion.

Describe what you found - dirt? "The esophagus expands into a thin-walled storage structure, the crop. Probe the wall of the crop gently and note its texture. Just posterior to the crop is the muscular gizzard. This is a grinding structure with thick, muscular walls (obvious by gentle probing). Food is passed from the gizzard to the intestine, where further digestion and absorption occur. The intestine ends at the anus." ( http://www.esu.edu/~milewski/intro_biol_two/lab__1... 7. "most (qworms) have a well-developed closed (circulatory) system. The typical arrangement is for the main contractile dorsal vessel to carry blood anteriorly while a number of vertical segmental vessels, often called hearts, carry it to the ventral vessel, in which it passes posteriorly. Segmental branches supply and collect blood from the respiratory surfaces, the gut, and the excretory organs." ( http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/118377/c... 10. "Nephridia are organs of excretion in the annelids. Flood your worm with water. Observe the body wall under a dissecting microscope. The nephridia are coiled tubules with an expanded funnel-shaped nephrostome. The nephrostome is attached to the septum dividing two segments and opens into the anterior segment. The tubule opens to the outside through the body wall within the posterior segment. Filtration of the blood across the tubule wall can occur because of the close association between capillaries and the nephridium." ( http://www.esu.edu/~milewski/intro_biol_two/lab__1...

http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/images/annelids.... 11. "The nervous system typically consists of a primitive brain, or ganglionic mass, located in the head region, connected by a ring of nerves to a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body; the cord gives rise to lateral nerves and ganglia in each segment. Sense organs of annelids generally include eyes, taste buds, tactile tentacles, and organs of equilibrium called statocysts."
