4 5 years ago Favorite Answer Let x be the number of pairs of socks and let y be the number of sweatshirts.

(When you multiply 13 dollars times the number of sweatshirts bought, it gives the total amount spent on sweatshirts.) Dollars spent on socks + Dollars spent on sweatshirts must be less than or equal to 50 dollars 5s + 13y ≤ 50 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Mike G Lv
