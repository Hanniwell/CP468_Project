9 years ago Finding an X co ordinate of a point on the terminal arm? Angle(theta) lies in quadrant II with point A(-4, 6) on the terminal arm. Point P is the point of intersection of the terminal arm of theta and the unit circle centered at (0,0). Determine the exact value of the X co ordinate of point P?

5 9 years ago Favorite Answer For the terminal arm, since one end is at the origin, the intercept value b of the terminal arm's straight-line equation y = mx + b must be b = 0. When y = 6 for this line, x = -4, so that the slope value m must be such that 6 = m*(-4) Thus m = -3/2. y = (-3/2)*x for all points of the terminal arm's line. For the unit circle, x^2 + y^2 = 1. Substitute for y from the straight-line equation into the circle's equation and get x^2 + [(-3/2)x]^2 = 1. You should be able to easily solve this equation for the x value of the point P on the circle.
Then substitute that x value back into the straight-line equation to find the y value for the point P. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post lherick Lv
