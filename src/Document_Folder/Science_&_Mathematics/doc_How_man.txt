1 decade ago How many fundamental notes can be produed by a three-valve trumpet? why? Answer Save 7 Answers Relevance duetrombe 1 decade ago Favorite Answer There are seven fundamental notes on a three valve trumpet.
Starting with: C
-
fingered
( 0 ) B
-
fingered
( 2 ) Bb/A#
-
fingered
( 1 ) A
-
fingered
( 12 ) or ( 3 ) roughly the same length Ab/G#
-
fingered
( 23 ) G
-
fingered
( 13 ) Gb/F#
- fingered
( 123 ) There is no fundamental F, E, Eb/D#, D, or Db/C#.
These notes are produced as part of the natural harmonic series of the other notes.
For example, you can play the F on the first space of the staff because it is part of the series that starts on Bb and you can play the E on the first line as it is in the A series.
You would need a four valve instrument to have fundamental notes on all 12 notes in the scale. P.S. Bugles have only one fundamental note.
All the notes above it are based on that note.
They are called harmonics or partials.
The 1st partial in the series is the fundamental note, whereas the 1st harmonic is the 2nd note in the series.
A three valve trumpet is made up of seven of these fundamental "bugles." Source(s):

6 1 decade ago This is a poorly worded question, because it seems to be mixing questions regarding valve positions and how a trumpet makes music. Trumpets make sounds by a combination of valve positions (fingering) AND the way you blow into it (embouchure). It turns out that you can play some of the same notes with a different combination of fingering and embouchure. If it helps, think of a bugle.
It's very similar to a trumpet, except that it has no fingering valves.
The change is pitch is ONLY controled by embouchure, yet a bugel has more than just one fundamental note. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago I dont know the exact number but i do play trumpet and u can get a higher or lower note with the same number of valves but u change ur lips and tounge hope this is useful 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post thats pretty spiffy!!!! 1 decade ago 12 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer. Sign in Tetley 1 decade ago the answer is 2^3 or 8 there are 2 positions of each valve and 3 valves therefore the number of combinations is 8.
Which also kinda goes hand in hand that there are 8 notes in an octave. =P 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago i think it like 42. to get different notes, ur embouchure has to change 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post schoolgirl 1 decade ago dk 0 0 1 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
