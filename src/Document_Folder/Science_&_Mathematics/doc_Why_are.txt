1 decade ago why are fossils more likely to be formed in shale and sandstone than in conglomerate? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Shale and sandstone are formed from slowly running water while conglomerate is deposited from rapidly moving water.
It is the slow water that gently buries the animal which turns into the fossil.
Rapidly moving water disperses the parts. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now. Ask Question + 100 Join Yahoo Answers and get 100 points today.
