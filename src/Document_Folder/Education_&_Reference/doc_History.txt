1 decade ago History project Jean Talon? I'm doing a history project on the first intendant of New France, Jean Talon.
I have two questions: 1/ what role did he play in the development of New France? 2/ i have to do a presentation on him, including the use of a visual aid. I don't want to do a PPP or a poster. I want to do something unique. Any suggestions? Update : You don't have to answer the first question, but plz answer the second question! Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer 1. Go to: "Research your answer" on your question page. 2. Type in: Jean Talon 3. You'll get the answer to your first question, but look under "Honors" as well. Get a wig from a costume store (what a perfect time of year). If it isn't as curly as his hair, let a beautican style one for you. The cost shouldn't be that great. Go dressed as Jean Talon when you make your report. As for the honorary sites: Go to: www@mapquest.com.Using your school as the starting location, find out what the directions are from there to these points. Any extra material you find on each honor (ie: why the honor was bestowed) would "put a feather" in your cap! Good luck! 0 1 2 Login to reply the answers Post quatt47 Lv
7 1 decade ago Jean Talon, Comte d'Orsainville (1625, baptised 8 January 1626 – November 1694) was a French colonial administrator who was the first and most highly regarded Intendant of New France. Life He was born at Châlons-sur-Marne, to Philippe Talon and Anne de Bury in 1625. He was very entrepreneurial and as Intendant during 1665–1672, he attempted to diversify the colony's economy by encouraging agriculture, fishing, lumbering, and industry as well as the traditional fur trade. He approved Robert La Salle's plan to mount expeditions to seek a western passage to China In 1666, he conducted the first census in North America, counting 3,215 of its residents. While he succeeded in settling some 2,000 people in the colony, many of the industries that he had initiated failed when he returned to France. Talon worked closely with lieutenant-general Prouville de Tracy to achieve the surrender of the Iroquois in 1627, thereby ending the threat that had hung over the colony for 20 years. Although Talon did not join the troops in the field, at Tracy's request, he had a very large share in the success of the French arms through his constant and meticulous care in placing at the disposition of the army everything that was necessary for the war, despite the poverty of the colony, the lack of roads, and the distances. He died in France in 1694. He was a highly respected man and loved by many, yet he was never married. Jean studied at the Jesuit college of Clermont in Paris, so his knowledge was much appreciated by King Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who were to help in the colonization of New France. Honors Several sites and landmarks were named to honor Jean Talon. They include: Rue Jean-Talon (Jean Talon Street), located in Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;
The Jean Talon Building (Building 5) in Tunney's Pasture,Ottawa, Ontario;
The provincial electoral district of Jean-Talon, Quebec;
Metro Jean-Talon (Jean Talon subway station), the intersection of the orange (line 2) and the blue (line 3) subway lines in Montreal, Canada;
Rue Jean-Talon (Jean Talon Street), an important street of 14,01 kilometers (8,71 miles) going East and West in the city of Montreal
That's a resume of what he did. Why not a collage depicting the things that interested him? Agriculture, fishing, industry, lumber and furs, perhaps a map showing the route to China via the North West passage and the treaty with the Irrequois Indians. 0 1 1 Login to reply the answers Post Abdul 5 years ago this is so frustrating 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
