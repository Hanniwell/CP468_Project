10 years ago Lesson ideas on future tense? I am kind of stuck here. I need some ideas for a lesson plan on "future tense" for my TESL course. We have ten minutes time to do a "microteaching" on this topic. How can I present this in an interesting way with student engagement? Answer Save 2 Answers Relevance meenakshi Lv
7 10 years ago Favorite Answer Here are many links on how to teach future tense. Just browse through them & I'm sure you'll be able to garner many ideas from the same. http://www.google.co.in/search?client=opera&rls=en... And these links are for Micro teaching future tense : http://www.google.co.in/search?client=opera&rls=en... You can have pictures or flash cards that show an action taking place [you could use little film strips too]. However, leave the action unfinished, & ask the class what will happen next, or similar questions to elicit the 'future tense' response. Some comparative flash cards can show the completed task - to indicate past tense; while you could also show the present where action is going on.
You could also ask the kids to formulate questions based on flash card action & thence elicit the difference between the 3 tenses, focusing, of course, on the future tense. Choose action(s) that kids would enjoy & would eagerly await. I would, ideally, go for a cartoon film with their fav characters. And use the 'pause' buttons to ask or elicit Q & As. Choose only about 3 or 4 verbs so as to keep within the time frame. Hope these help All the best :-) Source(s):
