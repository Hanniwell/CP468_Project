4 10 years ago Favorite Answer sometimes you gotta run away so you can see who will run after you. sometimes you gotta talk quicker just to see who's listening. sometimes you gotta step up in a fight just to see who's standing by your side. sometimes you gotta make wrong decisions just to see who's there to fix it. sometimes you gotta let go of the one you love just to see if they love you enough to come back.
