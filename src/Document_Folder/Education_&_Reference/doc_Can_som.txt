1 decade ago Can someone rephrase this sentence so that i can understand it.? The reasoning is that faults in volcaniclastics and breccias can gouge the rock surfaces, producing characteristic marks, including striations, ridges and grooves, crescentic scours around projections, and "stoss and lee" effects such as "rat tails" behind boulders, and these marks are comparable to drumlins and elongated low profile flutings. Update : its about John Shaws theories about the formation of drumlins Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance ukcufs Lv
5 1 decade ago Favorite Answer They are saying that faults in volcaniclastics and breccias [<-- dunno what these are must be specific to what it is about] can scrape the rock surfaces. This leaves unique marks on the rocks, including [more names of stuff -->] striations, ridges and grooves, crescentic scours around projections, and "stoss and lee" effects such as "rat tails" behind boulders, and these marks are comparable [similar] to drumlins and elongated [<< stretched] low profile [<< not very noticeable] flutings. Thats the best I can do as I don't know the specifics of what it is on about. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now.
