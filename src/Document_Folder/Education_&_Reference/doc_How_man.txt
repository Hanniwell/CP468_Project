1 decade ago How many fundamental notes can be produed by a three-valve trumpet? why? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance duetrombe 1 decade ago Favorite Answer There are seven fundamental notes on a three valve trumpet. Starting with: C - fingered ( 0 ) B - fingered ( 2 ) Bb/A# - fingered ( 1 ) A - fingered ( 12 ) or ( 3 ) roughly the same length Ab/G# - fingered ( 23 ) G - fingered ( 13 ) Gb/F# - fingered ( 123 ) There is no fundamental F, E, Eb/D#, D, or Db/C#. These notes are produced as part of the natural harmonic series of the other notes. For example, you can play the F on the first space of the staff because it is part of the series that starts on Bb and you can play the E on the first line as it is in the A series. You would need a four valve instrument to have fundamental notes on all 12 notes in the scale. Think of each valve as a bugle in a different key.
A bugle only has one fundamental note and therefore can only play the harmonic series of that particular pitch. I hope that this information helps. Source(s):
