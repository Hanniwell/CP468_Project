1 decade ago Is the tense correct in these sentences and why? If it is his mother, I am running away. If it is his mother, I will be running away. Answer Save 5 Answers Relevance Laura 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Yes, the verb tense is correct in both sentences. "is his mother" is a generalization/fact about the subject "it" (the person identified as "it" was his mother in the past, is his mother now, and will be his mother in the future) Therefore use of the Simple Present tense is appropriate in the first part of the sentence. (See use #2 at

) "I am running" refers to an action which will take place in the near future (if the first action is true).
This is an acceptable use of Present Continuous tense. (See use #3 at

) "I will be running"
refers to a continuous action which will be occurring in the future if and when the first action occurs, which is an appropriate use of the Future Continuous tense. (See use #1 at

) "I will be running away" is more formally "correct", whereas "I am running away" is a more colloquial use of the language. Source(s):

Just additional details: But on the first part of the sentence, it depends. Because if the situation is the mother is on the phone, it can also be like this: "If THAT is his mother, I am/will be running away." But if the situation is the mother is in front of the door or knocking at the door, the sentence could be like this: "If IT is his mother, I am/will be running away." But there could also be another situation where you can use the pronoun SHE. You are going to use it when the mother is being introduced to someone. It goes like this: "If SHE is his mother, I am/will be running away." Just compare the differences between the pronouns. Hope this helps. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post leila 1 decade ago In the first one: yes because you can say i am running away like i am going to run away
in the second one: yes and its probably better english than the first one 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post dorwarth Lv
4 4 years ago The demanding is right, yet i might advise deleting "or not if" and preserving the style of folk the comparable -- "he or she...they desire their" (to that end, i might advise using only one, extremely than asserting he or she each and every time). here is what i'm basically asserting: whilst a fashion designer creates a photograph, he ought to continuously be sure no rely if he needs his photograph to coach lightness or darkness. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?
