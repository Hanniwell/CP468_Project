1 decade ago Does anyone know any fiable internet sites/articles on Jean Talon: First Intendant of New France? I have been looking for quite some time and I do believe it's the first time Google has let me down...and I really didn't want to skim through 50 pages of worthless sites. It does not matter whether the site/article is in french or english...I can read both. French would actually be prefered! Thanks team!
