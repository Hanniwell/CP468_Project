9 years ago can two people from different houses have the same postal code? Answer Save 8 Answers Relevance S M 9 years ago Favorite Answer Yes. Postal codes are assigned for a range of houses on the same street, usually in a range of numbers. If you are interested in finding what residences share the same postal code, you can do a reverse search with Canada Post under the "Find an Address" section. Just type in a postal code and it will give you the number range of the residences that use that postal code. http://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/fpc/persona... Source(s):

6 9 years ago Yes... a postal code (also known as a ZIP code or a post code) goes by city/town.
So if the 2 people live in the same city/town, they SHOULD have the same postal code.
At least that's how it's assigned in the US. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer.
