1 decade ago Between York &Concordia University,which university is better for undergraduate in Biology?Only rate those two? Give reasons why you would think one is better than the other. Thank you! Also which city is better to live in Toronto or Montreal? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Alisha 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Corcondia is in Montreal and unless you're conversant in French, I'd rather live in English-speaking Toronto so my choice is York University. Both schools have excellent undergrad programs in Biology. Also, Toronto has a more cosmopolitan and international population. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
