4 years ago Does being a good businessman make you a good president? Does being a good lawyer make you a good doctor? Answer Save 8 Answers Relevance Anonymous 4 years ago No, a businessman's objective is to make profit. They do not care if they have to fire people or get rid of the 'dead wood' they just want to make money. That is the aim of businessmen. Being president is helping EVERYONE.

7 4 years ago No, in fact I'd argue that businessmen tend to be unsuited for public office due to their temperament. The key word here is SERVICE.
Business is all about obtaining for one's self. Ideally, public service would require a level of community-mindedness that one rarely finds in businessmen. 0 3 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 4 years ago We do know that being a mediocre community organizer makes you a totally shitty President. 0 0 3 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?
