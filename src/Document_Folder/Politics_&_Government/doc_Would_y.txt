5 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Based on this, I probably wouldn't hire you.
Things that I would change: the objective--it is too narrow and gives a time line.
I want to hire someone who is interested in food service, library work, or whatever the job entails.
I also want to at least think that the person wants to be there long-term, especially if the company has to put in the time to train him or her.
Don't lie if the interviewer asks outright, but in your resume, you shouldn't put a timeline on it if you know that it will be less than a year.
An ojective should be more along the lines of: to gain experience in the _________ industry and blah blah blah, more stuff specific to the position.
Rink Attendant should be a line under Qualifications and the dutie listed should be bulleted.
As it is, it looks like sentence fragments.
In this section, "run Public Skate" is not grammatically correct.
It should be "ran" or better yet "managed."
You should mention if you supervised anyone or had any cash handling experience at any of the jobs, but especially this one.
For the public library position, I would be a little more specific about what you did there.
You don't need to write a novel, but be a little more descriptive--were you interacting with the public or more behind the scenes in the organization process?
I don't think that you should mention the classes that you are taking under the education section.
Just "currently enrolled in Town Secondary School, on course to graduate May, 2009" or something like that.
If you are in honors courses, make it "currently enrolled in the Town Secondary School, set to graduate with honors May 2009."
The last section should be bulleted and more like: Extracurricular: --Figure skating --Environmental Club Awards Received: --Honor Roll --Mathematics and Computing Award Maybe a lot of this is a cut and paste/different format issue, but I brought it up in case it wasn't.
A resume in outline format with bulleting has a much cleaner appearance.
I hope that it doesn't seem like I was hard on you, but these days, there is so much competition for jobs that if the resume doesn't leave a good impression, you may not make it to the interview phase. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Pfo Lv
