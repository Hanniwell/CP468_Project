8 years ago what to do with failed butterscotch brownies? I made some butterscotch brownies, while trying to make up a recipe based on another fudge recipe.
But I think I put in too much liquid (bit too much oil probably) so they are raw-tasting and too soft.
I have the better part of a pan of these left, is there anything good that I could do with these failed brownies?
Create something else yummy perhaps?
does anybody have any ideas. Thanks :) Answer Save 4 Answers Relevance Jodi D Lv
7 8 years ago Favorite Answer Place small pieces on a lightly buttered cookie sheet.
Flatten them with a fork.
Bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
They'll be crisp butterscotch cookies. Or, take them out of the pan.
Roll them out on a lightly floured surface.
Use as crust for cheesecake or chocolate cream pie.
If your cheesecake or pie will be the no-bake kind, bake the crust for 10 minutes before filling it. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post iShallCallHimSquishy Lv
