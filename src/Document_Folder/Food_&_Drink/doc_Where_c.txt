1 decade ago Where can I get Lifesaver's Butterscotch in Vancouver BC? I can't find them anywhere, and they aren't listed on the Wrigley's website anymore, anyone know where I can get them? Or have they been discontinued? Update : I was actually looking for a store, and they aren't readily available in Seattle either... Lizzy it looks like those are butter rum not butterscotch (they're just not quite the same...)

I dont omit no longer having a motor vehicle - we even get public transport to the mountains and Whistler and the ferry for Vancouver Island and so on.
