5 1 week ago You might be referring to what's called "Fast Casual" restaurants like Pei Wei, Panera Bread, Taco Cabana or Noodles & Company.  These places are generally more upscale than fast food but you pay at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  A lot independent restaurants do it as well.  Some places don't want to have servers but rather runners who aren't dependent on tips. It's not really new but I think a lot more places are choosing that format 0 0 Anonymous 1 week ago I’m pretty sure McDonald’s has been this way for 70 years 1 0 Still have questions?
