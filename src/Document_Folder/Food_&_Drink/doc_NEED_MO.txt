5 1 decade ago Monaco: Socca (Rustic Chickpea-flour Crepe) Socca is a popular street food in Monaco, Nice and other areas along the south coast of France. It's a thin cake or pancake of chickpea flour, water, and olive oil cooked on a griddle. Monegasques buy a chunk of hot socca to eat with a cool glass of wine. 2 cups chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
3 tablespoons olive oil
2-1/4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
Pepper
In a blender, mix until smooth the flour, 3 tablespoons olive oil, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt Place a heavy griddle or 10- to 12-inch frying pan 4 to 6 inches over a solid bed of coals at medium-high heat (or on a range at medium-high heat). When pan is hot enough for a drop of water to dance, brush surface generously with oil. Pour enough batter to cover pan surface about 1/8 inch thick; use about 1 cup batter for a 10-inch round, 1-1/3 cups for a 12-inch round, 2 cups for a 16-inch round. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until bottom is lightly browned and top is dry to touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Slash pancake into random-shaped serving-size pieces (about 2 by 3 inches). Slide off griddle with a wide spatula and mound into a napkin or onto a plate to eat hot. Repeat to cook remaining batter. Makes about 8 appetizer servings. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Prince Albert Millefeuille Pastry with Strawberries & Whipped Cream

1/4 cup olive oil
1 tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped fine
1/2 cup white-wine vinegar
