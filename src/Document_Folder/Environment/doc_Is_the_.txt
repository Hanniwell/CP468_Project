6 years ago Is the West Antarctic melting from volcanic activity? http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2014/10/new-pape... Update : MTRstudent. volcanic eruptions are not constant look at the present Icelandic eruption, and any way a small amount of warming would lubricate glaciers, causing a faster flow towards the ocean.

7 6 years ago Favorite Answer Certainly looks like a likely explanation for why 10% of Antarctica is losing ice while the other 90% is gaining. http://news.yahoo.com/hidden-volcanoes-melt-antarc... http://www.newsmax.com/LarryBell/Obama-Antarctic-C... Hmmm, the area with the fastest melting just happens to be the area with the most intense sub glacial volcanic activity. 0 5 0 Login to reply the answers Post MTRstudent Lv
6 6 years ago The heat from volcanic activity is far too small to explain the ice losses we've measured in Antarctica. You'd also need to explain why Antarctoc oce loss has accelerated in recent years. If these volcanoes have been around for ages, why did the melt only start in recent decades? The same authors wrote a study about Thwaites glacier earlier this year, which was also misunderstood by journalists and bloggers who didn't have the time to read or the technical ability to understand the paper. They sent an email to clarify this, which you can read here: http://lists.cryolist.org/htdig.cgi/cryolist-cryol... 0 3 4 Login to reply the answers Post BB Lv
7 6 years ago Undersea Volcanic activity has not been studied 'in depth' as to its impact on ocean temperatures.
I hope that there is an increased effort to study same .....instead of summarily dismissing the potential influence. 1 2 0 pegminer Lv
7 6 years ago Report The geophysical heat flux has been extensively studied. It's not warming the ocean to any appreciable degree. Have you ever looked at a book on geophysics? Login to reply the answers Post milton b Lv
7 6 years ago No, it isn't.
A volcano or even several volcanoes can't produce enough heat to explain the amount of ice being lost by the West Antarctic ice sheet. 2 1 6 ... Show all comments Kano Lv
7 6 years ago Report and if volcanic activity is not doing it, what is, temperatures are almost always below freezing, a few degrees warmer still would not be enough to melt. Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer. Sign in Elmer98 Lv
