7 years ago Antarctic ship rescued - who pays? Good news for the passengers and crew of the research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy which has been trapped in Antarctic sea ice since
Christmas
eve:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25573096 I can't estimate the cost of the rescue but it has to be in the millions, perhaps many millions.
So who pays for this rescue? Update : ___________________________________________________________________________ @C:
"And this pertains to GW how exactly" Here is a primer for you to get more informed on this expedition:
http://www.spiritofmawson.com/the-science-case/ "What does it matter who pays." It matters to those who pay.
Is this a foreign concept to you? "Who pays when skiers are trapped in Finland, or a yacht needs rescuing off Australia?????" It depends on many factors.
That's why I asked this question. Update 2 : ___________________________________________________________ @******:
I'm not sure how Watts or Coleman relate to this question but I did find this regarding the situation they put themselves in:
http://datascinz.blogspot.co.nz/2014/01/could-bett... (Note:
Although you may not accept that website since they refer to the Watts and Coleman issue, whatever that is.) Update 3 : ________________________________________________________________ @Some1Has:
"Why is this question being asked under the "Global Warming" section? How does it pertain to AGW?" Let's see.
It is a scientific research ship.
It had climate scientists aboard.
They went to Antarctic to make some scientific readings.
The scientists claim that there are identified parts of the East Antarctic which are highly susceptible to melting and collapse from ocean warming. You know, I see your point.
There is no connection between CO2 and the Antarctic other than the excessive amounts these ships and helicopters emitted during this expedition and subsequent rescue operations resulting in some very important scientific tweets. Update 4 : ____________________________________________________________ @******:
Does your edit have anything to do with who pays for this rescue? (i.e. answering this question) Update 5 : ___________________________________________________________ @Some1Has:
"Ottawa Mike, the only thing that you see is what you are willing to see." No, this is exactly your problem.
This question is about who pays for a rescue operation.
What you see is an AGW proof/non-proof argument where none is to be found. Sometimes a question about who pays for a rescue is just a question about who pays for a rescue.
If you go back to your "why is this is Global Warming" well I already gave you a reason for that. You must see a boogedyman in every closet and under every bed.
If you don't be careful, you're going to turn into ******. Answer Save 10 Answers Relevance virtualguy92107 Lv
7 7 years ago Favorite Answer The law of the sea applies whether the ship is carrying scientists, tourists, or cargo. GW doesn't enter into it, and your reference doesn't mention law of the sea at all. According to the Antarctic treaty, the Australian government is responsible for coordinating rescue operations in the area of the Southern Ocean where the rescue took place. Also by treaty, rescue operations at sea are conducted without charge to the rescued party regardless of who does the rescuing and the nearest vessel capable of rendering aid is required to assist. The nearest government search and rescue entity is required to take over the rescue as soon as possible to avoid undue financial or commercial strain on the vessel conducting the initial rescue. Salvage, on the other hand, is subject to commercial contract - one reason that the Russian crew is still on board.
I would have thought that someone who has claimed background as a marine engineer would know this. Those who are calling the crew morons are apparently unaware of the number of ships requiring assistance due to being stuck in ice every year. Ice can be piled up to impassable conditions within hours even in sheltered seas and lakes, nevermind open ocean, and you can't really tell how thick the ice is until you hit it. The U.S icebreaker Glacier, capable of breaking 20 ft ice, was stuck for a while in the Weddell Sea, too remote for rescue, in 1978. Recent headlines have mentioned cargo vessels on the Great Lakes and a 1000 passenger ferry in the Baltic near Stockholm. 0 3 1 Login to reply the answers Post John Lv
4 7 years ago This is a rescue at sea. Who pays for rescues at sea? For that matter, who pays for search and rescue operations on land or at sea? -
http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/pay-for-search-... Why is this question being asked under the "Global Warming" section? How does it pertain to AGW? Added** Ottawa Mike, the only thing that you see is what you are willing to see. Had this been a whaling vessel or an oil exploration vessel then what would it prove? That ships become stranded in sea ice? Yes, that is exactly why proves and nothing else. No matter the mission of the ship, the fact that it has become stranded in sea ice neither proves nor disproves the purpose of the mission. I truly wish that it was so simple as for a ship to become stranded in sea ice to disprove the AGWT. Your sense of logic shows some very serious weaknesses. How does your logic fail you, oh let me count the ways! 0 4 2 Login to reply the answers Post Gringo Lv
6 7 years ago <<So who pays for this rescue? >> Usually the person responsible for getting trapped in the ice in the first place. No matter how much the usual denier sites try to twist this whole story, the scientific research leader of the expedition is not responsible; only the vessels' crew and its Captain are. And contrary to what Anthony Watts has been claiming on his blog, the stranded Russian ship did not request John Coleman/Anthony Watts' assistance. That is a major and perhaps deliberate mix up first committed by John Coleman himself and later continued by Watts. Edit @ OttaWatts Mike: <<(Note: Although you may not accept that website since they refer to the Watts and Coleman issue, whatever that is.) >> You're the one who reads WUWT on a daily basis yet now you claim to be unaware of what I am talking about. Come on, it's all over the denier blogs, not just WUWT. The link you provide is another example of selective skepticism the denier crowd is so accustomed to. The writer of the blogpost immediately takes for granted the claim that "American TV meteorologists have been called on to provide assistance to the AAE" and the rest of his post is entirely based on that wrong assumption. And the whole wrong assumption stems from John Coleman (deliberately?) misunderstanding what his own meteorologist said in a previous segment. You can watch for yourself in the KUSI-TV video linked below. At around 1:26 David Scott starts his segment and is very clear who called him and aboard what ship this person was (the Polar Star which was heading for Sydney, Australia at that time). At about 3:40 however, Coleman spins it single handedly to (paraphrasing) 'supply it to the scientists off the north coast of Antarctica'.
A took a bunch of real 24/7 skeptics over at the blog mentioned below to not only find out just who this 'US scientist aboard the Polar Star' actually was but also to contact him and confirm that Coleman/Watts' account of events is fundamentally wrong. But not a single fake skeptic spotted the error.
They were all too busy congratulating Watts on 'his heroic effort' while having a good deal of Schadenfreude. Edit 2 @ Ottawatts Mike: << Does your edit have anything to do with who pays for this rescue? (i.e. answering this question) >> I gave you my answer in the very first line. You must have missed that. PS Your buddy Sagebrush did not answer your question at all. Doesn't he deserve some special attention on your behalf? Source(s):

7 7 years ago The organizers should be made to pay as they originated this stupid idea.
As to those who go that no one should be paid, how many of you work for nothing - RAISE YOUR HANDS!
Anyone?
Thought not.
As soon as you work for free then you can ask others to do the same.
I on the other hand want to see a paycheck. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers? You can sign in to vote the answer. Sign in Sagebrush Lv
7 7 years ago Don't celebrate too much Mike. The latest news is that the rescue ship, Xue Long, is now ice bound. Mother Nature just won't give these 'saviors of the earth' a break.
How many PhDs does it take to get stuck in the ice? Don't worry, we'll pay for it somehow. 0 3 4 Login to reply the answers Post Ian Lv
