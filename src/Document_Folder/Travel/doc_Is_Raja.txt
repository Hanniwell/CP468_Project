1 decade ago Is Rajasthan all it looks like to be? In the Cheetah Girls movie, it looked amazing. I might be going to India for the first time in 2 years, and I really want to go see all the good tourist attractions. Update : Thanks Hamza. Your cool and all but you have skin issues man. Answer Save 6 Answers Relevance Anonymous 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Impregnable forts and palaces, picturesque lakes, shimmering deserts and exotic wild lives - Rajasthan offers you a heady mix. Tourist attractions in Rajasthan lie in its intriguing heritage, colorful villages and vibrant songs and dances.
Visit any city in Rajasthan; it will charm you with its wealth of attractions. Old palaces, which were once resided by the Kings and princes, have now been open to the tourist for accommodation. Simply the taste of royal hospitality would bowl you over. Some important cities in Rajasthan are: Jaipur: The capital city of Rajasthan is home to a host of tourist attractions in Rajasthan. Architectural marvels like Hawa Mahal, Amber Fort, the Observatory, Jal Mahal, Jaigarh Fort bears testimony to the technological advancements in a bygone age and grandiose lifestyles of Indian Maharajas. Udaipur: The landscaped city is often dubbed as the "Venice of the East". The City Palace Museum, Sahelion ki Bari, Jag mandir, the temples of Nathwada and Eklingji would remind you the glories of a romantic past. An evening boat cruise in the Lake Pichola, around which picturesque forts, palaces and havelis stand, would amount to a fairytale experience. You can also take an excursion to Rankapur, Kumbhalgarh and Chittorgarh. Jodhpur: On the edge of the Great Indian Desert, in this city, a chivalrous and sensuous past comes alive in the invincible Meharan Garh Fort, the sprawling Umaid Bhawan Palace, the graceful cenotaph of Jaswant Thada, the beautiful Madore Garden. Take an excursion to the nearby tribal Bishnoi village to visit the to exotic wild life & nature. Jaisalmer: in the heart of the desert, this is the city of famous Golden Fort. The yellow sandstone that the fort is made of, takes a shimmering golden hue with the beams of the setting sun. Visit the intricately carved havelis. A camel safari would take you right into the desert, which is one of the prime tourist attractions in Rajasthan. Ride through the sandy track and pitch your tent in the evening amid the rolling sand dunes. Camp fire, mashaals, folk dances and music - it is a tale from the Arabian Nights. Pushkar: Lying around the sacred Pushkar Lake, the idyllic township is the holy place. The place houses the only Brahma Temple in the world. During the Pushkar Festival in October-November, millions of people gather to take a dip in the holy lake. Close by, lie the holy place of Ajmer. Ranthambore:Sprawling over the rugged terrain of Aravali and Vindhyan ranges, this is one of the finest Tiger Reserves in India. Once the private hunting ground of the Maharaja of Jaipur, it is home to many other animals like: bear, wild boar, Leopard, Sambhar, Chital, Nilgai, Jungle cat etc. Apart from the above, several other tourist attractions in Rajasthan literally dot over the map of the state. Following are also worth a visit: Barmer, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Sariska, Kota, Mandawa, Mount Abu, Shekhawati. 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 1 decade ago I feel quite funny, when NRIs talk like this :-). They should consider India as their own country and not a tourist spot :(. When u r in India...u will not find it a big deal to find the best tourist locations...it cannot be provided by the non Indians for sure :-) 0 1 0 Login to reply the answers Post manojku 1 decade ago yes Rajasthan has lot of tourist attractions to view like historical palace forts crafts music etc and also visit other parts for hill, beaches, temples etc for adventure fun trips..
