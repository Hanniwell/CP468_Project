7 10 years ago Train ride between Innsbruck Austria and Liechtenstein / Switzerland...Totally beautiful ! Also the horrendous casms seen from the top of mountain ranges in Norway, even visible at some points on the train ride from Oslo to Bergen, near Finsk, Norway.
When you're travelling by train in Europe in those places, put down your travel guide-books and look at the amazing reality out the window. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post daruba Lv
