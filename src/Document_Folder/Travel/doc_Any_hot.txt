1 decade ago Any hotels near Brights Grove, Ontario? I want to travel to Brights Grove for a week or so, but I can't find any hotels nearby (according to google maps, the nearest one is at 9.4 km), so if anyone could help me find a nearer hotel, I would appreciate it! Answer Save 3 Answers Relevance cxj704 1 decade ago Favorite Answer Well I can suggest two options... Bright's Grove is quite close to Sarnia Ontario and if you have transportation, this would be your best choice as Sarnia is a small city with extensive hotels to choose from.
However, in Bright's Grove, you would probably be more likely to find a bed and breakfast to stay in than a motel.
Something that you might want to check out on a bed and breakfast website. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post Monnu 6 years ago Check here
