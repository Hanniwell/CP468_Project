1 decade ago is it good to have a tribute credit card? Answer Save 1 Answer Relevance Elvis D 1 decade ago Favorite Answer yes i would say i have a tribute card gold and i had bad credit at the time but just by making my payments ontime they gave me many credit increases i started with 300 and now i'm at 750. so it's a good company and they report to all 3 credit places.so look at it this way 450 credit increase in 1 year just by paying ontime. but don't spend more then 30 to 50% of the credit limit balance so your credit score just keeps going up.Never get a first premier credit card high annual and i have had it longer then my tribute and still no increase in limit.
