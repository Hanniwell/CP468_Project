7 2 years ago Depends what you mean by "better" (for themselves? for society?). Target stores are closed. They have done their damage. WalMart stores are still re-integrating the weight and measure system (pounds, US quarts) that no civilized country uses anymore. They have damaged employees' right to assemble and they have caused a drop of local salary averages, thus depressing local economies. Their damage continues. 3 0 Show more answers (15) Still have questions? Get your answers by asking now. Ask Question + 100 Join Yahoo Answers and get 100 points today.
