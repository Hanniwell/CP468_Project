5 1 decade ago Favorite Answer I used to live near Spruce Grove.
It's a small city of about 15,000 people, but it's next to Edmonton in a metropolitan area of over 1 million people.
Spruce Grove is booming, just like the entire capital city region.
It's basically a bedroom community for Edmonton, which is only 15 minutes away.
Spruce Grove is a quiet place to live, and has all the conveniences that Edmonton has to offer. Source(s):

4 4 years ago I find Edmonton to be a pretty nice city; I prefer it over Calgary. Business and recreation activities are pretty diverse...it has everything that other big cities have. Of course there are also a lot of jobs in Alberta in the energy/oil industry, but not a whole lot right in Edmonton. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post NONAME 1 decade ago Didn't like there. 0 0 3 Login to reply the answers Post Still have questions?
