Answer Save 28 Answers Relevance Drazen 1 month ago Favorite Answer that is terrible wtf 1 1 W 1 month ago Receive quickly, only limited time offer. https://mailchi.mp/1a3c5fda04c7/receive-paypal-100... 0 0 JT 1 month ago If you're not spending more than what you make (taking all expenses into consideration), then that's fine. Now having said that, it also depends on where you live...5 dollars an hour in the US is less than minimum wage and will probably not cut it. I made less than that when I started out in my current job. https://jtbusinesssolutions.wordpress.com/ 0 0 JustSassy 2 months ago In 1975, it may have been!  However, if you are not old enough to work in an established business, where you would legally have to earn minimum wage, and it works for you, then it's okay.  I must add that babysitters are getting around $10 an hour, though. 1 0 How do you think about the answers?
