4 1 decade ago Favorite Answer I have had tribute for a little over a year and they have been really good and consistent giving me credit limit increases(every 6 months). I have only had my salute 2 weeks ,so I can not say. Just remember to pay on time evry month, and if you can afford it, pay a little extra. They do both report to the credit bureaus, so they will help build or rebuild your credit. 0 0 0 Login to reply the answers Post rachger 1 decade ago I have had my Tribute card for a little over three years. It has helped build my credit. I do not have any complaints with them what so ever. I also have a Salute Visa and a Continental Finance Card. All three have build my credit great that caused me to get my Capital One Card and a Discover Card. Keep great payment history and it will pay off. I always payed at least 20 to 40 dollars more than my minimum and it pays off great and leads to perfect credit. Source(s):
